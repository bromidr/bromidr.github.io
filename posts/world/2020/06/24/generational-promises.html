  <p>God said, “Take now your son, your only son [of promise], whom you love, Isaac,
and go to the region of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one
of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”<cite>Genesis 22:2 AMP</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>God instructed Abraham to take his son, Isaac, to the region of Moriah and offer
him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains. Now, as mentioned in
previous posts, God can instruct you to go to a particular destination (as well
as take a particular route to said destination). In a <a href="/posts/world/2020/05/14/without-hesitation">previous post</a>,
Peter was instructed by the Holy Spirit to go to Caesarea and speak with a man
named Cornelius. In <a href="/posts/world/2020/04/30/vouch-for-him">another post</a>, Jesus had to go through Samaria to travel
to Galilee. And in yet <a href="/posts/world/2020/04/15/fragmentary">another post</a>, a prophet named Samuel instructed Saul
to take a specific route back to his father’s home. Those posts suggested that
you follow the instructions of the Lord by faith and without hesitation. So
Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his
young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split the wood for the burnt
offering, and then he got up and went to the place of which God had told him.
And on the third day [of travel] Abraham looked up and saw the place in the
distance (Genesis 22:3-4 AMP).</p>

<p>Abraham traveled for about three days to get to the place that God instructed
him to go. Likewise, the people from the stories in the previous posts—Peter,
Jesus, and Saul—traveled certain distances and lengths of time to get to the
place that the Holy Spirit instructed them to go. This time between when the
Holy Spirit instructs you to go somewhere to do something and when you get to
that somewhere provides a perfect opportunity for <a href="/posts/life/2018/12/05/did-god-really-say">the serpent</a> to introduce
doubt in your heart. As mentioned in that post, the serpent can do that by
getting you to question whether or not God really said what we think He said. As
such, while Abraham (or we) travel to the place that the Lord instructed us to
go, Abraham (or we) may wonder whether it was God’s voice that we heard speaking
to us or if it was just our inner voice and imaginations. And if the serpent is
successful in introducing this doubt into our hearts, then we may abandon our
journey to the destination and instead turn around and go back. But that ought
not to be! Instead, like Abraham, we should not waver in our belief in what the
Lord had told us and continue marching forward until we reach the place that the
Lord instructed us to go. Therefore, as it was mentioned in that post, we must
realize when the serpent is trying to use this tactic against us so that we may
guard against falling for this tactic of his.</p>

<p>We should also have the same mindset and thought process that Abraham had.
Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life
again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead (Hebrews
11:19 NLT). Abraham thought that nothing is impossible for God. And Abraham
reasoned that God is faithful—He keeps His promises because God is not a liar.
(One of God’s promises to Abraham required Isaac to grow up and marry someone
and start a family, which would be difficult to do if he were dead. Therefore,
Abraham reasoned that God would be able to bring his son back from the dead.)
Likewise, we should think that nothing is impossible for God. And we should
reason that God is faithful, that He shall keep His promises to us because He is
not a liar. Of course, as mentioned in <a href="/posts/life/2018/12/12/parable-of-the-sower">this post</a>, the serpent may try to
get you to doubt the veracity of what God told you. Whilst you are journeying
to where the Lord told you to go, the serpent may try to get you to doubt the
faithfulness of the Lord as well as His ability to keep His promises. And if the
serpent is successful in introducing this doubt into our hearts, we may abandon
our journey to the destination and instead turn around and go back. But that
ought not to be! Instead, like Abraham, we should not waver in our belief in
God’s faithfulness and abilities. Thus, as it was mentioned in that post, we
must realize when the serpent is trying to use this tactic against us so that we
may guard against falling for this tactic of his.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All these people died having faith. They didn’t receive the things that God
had promised them, but they saw these things coming in the distant future and
rejoiced. They acknowledged that they were living as strangers with no permanent
home on earth.<cite>Hebrews 11:13 GW</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>God keeps His promises, but that does not mean that those promises of His shall
be fulfilled within your lifetime. Rather, some of the promises that God tells
you may be fulfilled within the lifetime of future generations. You may think of
these as generational promises. Some of the things that God promised to Abraham
did not happen within his lifetime; rather, they happened in future generations.</p>

<p>An analogy can be found in the current events that are happening around the
world. A certain person had <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" title="I HAVE A DREAM...">a dream</a>: “A dream that one day this nation will
rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are created equal’” so that his “four little children
will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of
their skin but by the content of their character.” As current events can attest,
Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream was not fulfilled within his lifetime, but that
does that mean that his dream shall never be fulfilled. Rather, that dream of
his may be fulfilled within the lifetime of future generations, maybe even
within the lifetime of this generation.</p>

<p>Therefore, you should not lose hope or faith in God just because you do not see
His promises or your dreams come to pass within your lifetime. Rather, similarly
to Abraham, you should rejoice because of your belief that His promises and your
dreams shall come to pass in future generations. And similarly to Abraham, you
should share with your children the promises that God has made to you so that
they and future generations may also rejoice and know what is to come in their
lifetimes or the lifetimes of their descendents.</p>

<p>God bless.</p>
