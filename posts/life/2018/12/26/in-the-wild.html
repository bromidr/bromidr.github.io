<main class="container-main"><blockquote>
  <p>Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to
be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very
nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance
as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a
cross! <cite>Philippians 2:6–8 NIV</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the previous story it was mentioned that we sin when we do things that do not
come from faith. And since we have all sinned, we are all guilty according to
the law of sin and death. However, God did not destine us to wrath (pay the
penalty of that law—death); instead, we were always destined for eternal life.
Now, for God’s destiny for us to come to pass, we needed to be justified so that
we may be found innocent according to the law. And this justification can only
come through faith in Jesus Christ. It does not come through obedience of the
law that God gave through angels to Moses for the people of Israel (and is also
written in our hearts) because that is not the purpose of that law. And this is
also evident in the story of Jesus’ appearance as a man in human form. Mentioned
in the Scripture above, when Jesus appeared as a man in human form, He was
obedient, even to the point of death on a cross. Now, this obedience is not
referring to His obedience to the law that God gave to the people of Israel to
follow. Rather, this obedience is referring to His obedience to God the Father
in Heaven. While He was a man in human form, Jesus was always obedient to God
the Father in Heaven. And Jesus was always obedient to God the Father in Heaven
since He always had faith in Him; He never doubted Him. And since Jesus’ actions
were always done from faith, He never sinned against His Father in Heaven. In
other words, Jesus did what Adam and Eve (and the rest of us) were unable to do.
Since He always had faith in His God the Father in Heaven, He was justified in
the sight of God. And as it is written in the Scriptures: For this reason God
highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at
the name of Jesus every knee will bow—of those who are in heaven and on earth
and under the earth—and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:9–11 HCSB). Now, if this obedience
of His were referring to obedience of the law that God gave for the people of
Israel, then His justification in the eyes of His God the Father in Heaven would
have been based on works (obeying the law) instead of faith. And if that were
the case, then Jesus would be showing that it is possible for a person to be
justified through works, instead of only by faith. But that is not the case!
For, not even Jesus followed all of the statutes of the law. According to the
law that God gave Moses: Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the
seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work,
neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your
animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns (Exodus 20:9–10 NIV). And yet,
on many occasions Jesus did not rest on the Sabbath; instead, He did things that
are considered work (such as heal people). Though He did not always follow the
statutes of the law, Jesus did always follow His Father in Heaven. And because
of this, He was justified and without sin. Now, showing that even He was
justified by faith and not by works is not the only reason that He appeared as a
man in human form; He also came to learn obedience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with
loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was
heard because of his reverence. Although he was a son, he learned obedience
through what he suffered. <cite>Hebrews 5:7–8 ESV</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Jesus always did what His Father in Heaven told Him to do by faith, it
does not mean that He always wanted to do what His Father in Heaven told Him to
do. In fact, Jesus sometimes offered up prayers and supplications with loud
cries and tears because there were times when He preferred not to do the thing
that His Father in Heaven wanted Him to do. For example, it was mentioned in a
previous story that, after Jesus was arrested, two came forward and made
allegations against Him by misconstruing the words that He spoke in order to
find a reason to sentence Him to death. However, before Jesus was arrested, He
was offering up prayers and supplications to His Father in Heaven. He prayed,
“Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me;
nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will” (Mark 14:36 NKJV). Jesus
prayed that He would not have to go through with what His Father in Heaven
planned for Him, yet He did not disobey His Father in Heaven. Jesus instead did
that which He pleaded not to do because He had complete faith in His Father in
Heaven and trusted that He knew that which is best for Him. This obedience of
His was learned through the challenging situations that He went through whilst
appearing as a man in human form. Think about that. As mentioned in the first
Scripture quoted at the top of this story, Jesus is God. That is His very
nature. Not human. God. As God, He has authority over everything. Nothing is
above Him; instead, everything is under Him. And as God, He is king and ruler
over everything. As such, He is subject to no one; instead, all are subject to
Him. And because of the position that He holds, He has never had to obey anyone
else before; rather, all have had to obey Him. And then He made the choice to
leave His position of authority to make Himself nothing by taking on the very
nature of a servant when He appeared as a man in the form of a human. He went
from being, in nature, God to being, in nature, a servant. All of a sudden, He
was no longer a king or a ruler; He was a servant. As a servant, He had to learn
obedience as a man in the form of a human. And through this obedience that He
learned, He was made perfect (justified in the sight of His Father in Heaven).
And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who
obey him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek
(Hebrews 5:9–10 ESV).</p>

<p>Now, God the Father in Heaven may also tell you to do something that you, for
some reason, prefer not to do. And when that happens, you may do as Jesus did
and offer up prayers and supplications through loud cries and tears in hopes of
persuading God the Father in Heaven of freeing you from the something that He
asked you to do. (This is not to imply that you are bound or imprisoned by what
He asks you to do. You, of course, have freedom to decide whether or not do what
He asks.) And when you do that, God the Father in Heaven may decline to rescind
what He asked you to do, similarly to how God the Father in Heaven did not
rescind what He asked of Jesus when He offered up prayers and supplications to
Him. (Now, as it was mentioned in a previous story, while you may not understand
why He asked you to do something, there may be a reason for it: so that the
plans that He has for your life may be fulfilled.) Instead of rescinding what He
asked Jesus to do, God the Father in Heaven sent an angel from heaven to appear
by His side and strengthen Him so that He may have the resolve to continue on
and go forward and do what was asked of Him. Likewise, your God the Father in
Heaven might also provide you with comfort, encouragement, and strength so that
you may go through with what He asked of you. And when that occurs, you have a
decision to make: to obey God the Father in Heaven and the things that He wants
you to do, or to disobey Him and not do what God the Father in Heaven wants you
to do. And now, if I may, may I suggest for you to follow the example that Jesus
set by obeying your Father in Heaven and doing the things that He asked of you.
While you may not understand why He asked you to do such a thing, just trust in
Him and believe that He knows what is best for your life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he
might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make
propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered
when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. <cite>Hebrews
2:17–18 ESV</cite></p>

  <p>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses,
but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are — yet he did
not sin. <cite>Hebrews 4:15 NIV</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, learning obedience through what He experienced is not the only reason that
Jesus appeared as a man in human form. He also had to be made like His brothers
and sisters (human) in every respect so that He can experience being tempted in
every way. Being tempted is being allured into the doing something that you
should not do because of its seemingly desirable consequence. As mentioned in a
previous story, the serpent tempted Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil by outlining the seemingly desirable consequences of
eating from that tree. Jesus was also tempted in every which way, just as we
are. Through these experiences, He gained understanding of the temptations that
we face as well as empathy towards us who may succumb to them. Since Jesus has
experienced the temptations that we face, however did not succumb to them, He
may also help us to refrain from that which tempts us. For, if Jesus did not
have any experience with temptation, then He would also not understand the
temptations that we face. And if Jesus did not understand the temptations that
we face, then He would also not be able to empathize with us. Now, this may not
be too different from any other person. Not everyone have experienced the
situations that you have experienced. And if a person has not experienced what
you have experienced, then they may not understand the allure of that which
tempts you. And since they do not understand the allure of that which tempts
you, then they may not be able to empathize with your situation or know how to
help. Rather than empathizing with you, those who do not understand why you (or
anyone) would succumb to the allures of that which tempts them may instead look
down upon you and ignore you and abandon you and condemn you for your lack of
strength and ability to refrain from succumbing to that which tempts you. For
example, some people may have experience with the death of a loved one, the loss
of a job, the loss of one’s health, and the stresses that come with being in a
precarious financial situation. And because of those life experiences, they may
succumb to certain temptations that allure them. Now, those without such
experiences may not be able to understand those who are currently in the midst
of those types of experiences. And because they do not understand the things
that you are going through, they may not be able to empathize with you nor know
how to help you, comfort you, or strengthen you so that you could get through
your situation. Instead of empathizing with you, those who do not understand
what you are going through for lack of similar experience may instead look down
upon you or ignore you or abandon you, or even condemn you for your lack of
strength to refrain from that which tempts you and inability to get through your
situation you may be in the midst of. However, Jesus is not like those people
since He experienced much suffering and temptations whilst appearing as a man in
human form. Thus, you are not alone in your experiences. Jesus is always with
you. Unlike all His disciples who deserted Him when He was arrested in a garden
called Gethsemane, He shall faithfully stay by your side, for He knows what it
is like to be deserted by others. Likewise, He shall not condemn you or look
down upon you because of the situation that you are in; rather, He will show you
mercy and empathy, for He knows and understands the situation that you are in
since He Himself has experienced condemnation and a lack of mercy at the hands
of the people who arrested Him. And because of His personal experience, Jesus
may also provide comfort, support, and strength for you to overcome the
challenging situations that you are experiencing. Just believe.</p>

<p>One more thing. If Jesus did not experience all the things that we experience in
life, then He may be considered like those who are labeled the elite—those who
are out of touch with the reality of most people because they do not have
experience or understanding of the challenges that most of us face on a daily
basis—by the people of this day and age. And because of this, the elite are
also thought of as those who only have their own best interests at heart and
therefore do the things that they do out of personal ambition or self-centered
reasons and with no regard for the ill effects that it may cause to those who
are not considered a part of the elite. As such, those who are labeled the
elites may be considered people who only care about themselves whilst having no
cares or thoughts for those who are not considered the elite. Therefore, Jesus
had to experience all the things that we experience in life so that He may not
be considered as being elite or out of touch with the reality of the people of
this world. Likewise, Jesus also came to show us that He is not like the elite
who marginalize others while elevating themselves; rather, Jesus stood up for
those who are marginalized by the people who are considered the elite. And this
is evident in the Gospels. The scribes and Pharisees were viewed as the elite in
those times. Those elites looked down upon the others, such as sinners and tax
collectors, swindlers and adulterers, those who are sick and those who are
demon-possessed, and the like; and yet, Jesus always stood up for them. Jesus
never looked down upon them. Jesus never condemned them. Instead, Jesus had
compassion for them. And Jesus provided help in their time of need. And I
suggest that you do likewise. Whilst you may not be able to have the same
experiences that others have had in order to understand their current situation
in life and show them empathy like Jesus did, what you may do is refrain from
looking down upon them and condemning those whom you do not really know.
Likewise, may I also suggest that you do things with other people’s best
interest at heart instead of your own lest others experience ill effects due to
your actions. In this way, you may follow the example that Jesus set, as He had
our best interests at heart when He took up the cross and died for us so that
those who believe in Him may receive eternal life.</p>
