  <p>Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false
testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death. They did not
find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two
came forward, and said, “This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple
of God and to rebuild it in three days.’” <cite>Matthew 26:59–61 NASB</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in previous stories, anyone may accuse a person of certain things
on the public forum of their choice. And sometimes the allegations that someone
makes against a person are false. And yet, sometimes the people who hear those
false allegations believe them to be true. And, since those who hear those false
allegations believe them to be true, without fair trial or due process, those
who hear those false allegations judge the accused as guilty as well as mete out
the punishment that they have sentenced the accused to. And as mentioned in
previous stories, those who believe those false allegations to be true may
sentence you to a verbal stoning. You can also be imprisoned by the false
allegation and be put into solitary confinement, never to be released, by those
who believe the false allegations to be true, as they deem you to be a scourge
on society to be locked up and avoided at all costs. However, as was mentioned
in the previous stories, although you can find yourself isolated and abandoned
by the people of this world because of the public response to those false
allegations made against you, you are not alone. The Lord is always with you and
the Lord shall never abandon you. Also, the Lord knows what you are going
through because He Himself has experienced likewise.</p>

<p>The chief priests and the whole council kept trying to obtain false testimony
against Jesus, so that they might sentence Him to death. Many false witnesses
stepped forward and made false allegations against Him, including two who came
and said, “This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to
rebuild it in three days.’” When those two stepped forward and claimed that
Jesus said a certain thing, those two were misrepresenting what Jesus actually
said. What Jesus had actually said was, “Destroy this temple, and in three days
I will raise it up.” Besides purposefully misconstruing His words so that the
chief priests and whole council may have reason to sentence Him to death, those
two may have misconstrued His words due to an unintentional misunderstanding of
what He meant when He said those words. Whilst those two people who claimed that
Jesus said a certain thing may have thought He was referring to a temple that
took forty-six years to build when He said the words, “Destroy this temple…”,
in fact, the temple that He was referring to was His body. This purposeful or
unintentional distortion of the words that a person says happens in this day and
age as well. In this day and age, this may be referred to as fake news. And so,
if you hear about the words that someone allegedly said, may I suggest that you
refrain from condemning that someone since the person who made known and
attributed those words to that someone may have purposefully or unintentionally
misconstrued that someone’s words. As well, by refraining from condemning
someone for the words attributed to them by a person who brought to light and
attributed the words to that someone, you can avoid wrongfully convicting
someone for saying something that they did not really say. Instead, as mentioned
in previous stories, might I suggest you direct your gaze inwards to evaluate
yourself to see if you are with or without sin. And if you take the time to do
that, then I reckon that you shall be convicted by your conscience as it brings
to light the sins that you are with. By the same token, if you are an avid user
of social media platforms—such as Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and
Instagram—then just realize that what happened to Jesus may happen to you. One
day you may find yourself being condemned by a multitude of people after someone
decides to accuse you of saying a certain thing. And similar to how those two
people misconstrued the words that they claimed Jesus said, the someone who
chose to accuse you of saying a certain thing may also purposefully or
unintentionally misrepresent the words that they are attributing to you. And
with the advent and proliferation of the Internet and social media platforms
able to keep a history of all the words that you have shared with the world, it
has become really easy for a person to find and distort the words that you have
shared over the years. In Jesus’ time, the chief priests and the whole council
had to find someone willing to remember, share, and misconstrue the words that
He said. Now, a person just has to utilise a social media platform’s search
feature to find and misconstrue the words that a person has said over time. And
this person may choose to do such a thing to someone in order to imprison that
someone and destroy that someone’s life and future. Now, this is not too
different from what the chief priests and the whole council decided to do to
Jesus. They actively sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they may have
reason to sentence Him to death. And in addition to being sentenced to death,
Jesus also experienced beatings, mockings, having verbal stones being thrown at
Him, abandonment by the people of the world, as well as imprisonment. And so,
Jesus certainly knows what you are going through if you happen to find yourself
being condemned by a multitude of people of this world for the words that
someone has decided to bring to light and attribute to you.</p>

<p>Now, take heart! The condemnation and imprisonment Jesus experienced did not
last forever; it was only temporary. People of this world tried to keep Him in
the box (the tomb) that they placed Him inside and tried to keep Him from
escaping from the situation that they boxed Him into (by sealing the tomb and
placing a guard in front of the sealed tomb). The people of this world planned
to box Him into the situation that they placed Him in. While the people of this
world planned to keep Jesus imprisoned (in the tomb that they put Him inside and
sealed), never to be released, the Lord made a way to free Jesus from the
imprisonment that He was in. And after some time, the condemnation He
experienced at the hands of the people of this world ceased, the Lord made a way
to free Jesus from the imprisonment that He was in, He was raised up by the Lord
to sit at the right hand of the Power of God, and He was given all authority in
heaven and on earth. Like Jesus above, the imprisonment Joseph experienced
because of the false allegations that were made against him, as is mentioned in
the last story, did not last forever; it was only temporary. After a little
while, the Lord made a way for him to be freed from the imprisonment he was in.
And like Jesus above, Joseph was lifted him up by the Lord. Joseph was made a
father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of
Egypt. Therefore, if you find yourself, like Jesus and Joseph, being imprisoned
by purposefully or unintentionally misconstrued allegations that someone decided
to make against you, just believe and know with certainty in your heart that
what you are experiencing shall not last forever; it is only temporary. And
similar to Jesus, the people of this world may try to keep you in the prison
that they put you in. The people of this world may try and keep you from
escaping from the situation that they boxed you into. And the people of this
world may have plans to box you into the situation that they placed you in.
While the people of this world planned to keep you imprisoned, like Jesus and
Joseph, the condemnation that you experience at the hands of the people of the
world shall cease, the Lord shall make a way to free you from the imprisonment
that you are in, and the Lord will lift you up to a wonderful future. Just
believe, for the plans that the Lord has for your life are greater than the
plans that people of this world has for your life. And His plans for your life
shall prevail over the people of this world’s plans for your life similarly to
how the Lord’s plans for Jesus’ and Joseph’s lives prevailed over the people of
this world’s plans for their lives.</p>

<p>Now, you may wonder why the Lord allowed you to experience such a thing in the
first place. As it is mentioned in the previous story, Joseph might have
wondered the same thing whilst in the midst of the turmoil that he was
experiencing as it might not have been readily apparent at the time. But, in the
process of time, Joseph eventually realized in hindsight: “God sent me ahead of
you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a
great deliverance. Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has
made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all
the land of Egypt” (Genesis 45:7–8 HCSB). Joseph also realized that: “You
intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this
position so I could save the lives of many people” (Genesis 50:20 NLT). With
some foresight, Jesus ascertained that: “But all this has taken place so that
the Scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled” (Matthew 26:56 AMP). Now, God
the Father in Heaven assuredly could have intervened and prevented the things
that happened to Jesus. Jesus Himself was sure of this, as He says: “Do you
think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will immediately provide Me with
more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matthew 26:53 AMP) However, if such an
appeal were granted, then the plans that God the Father in Heaven had for Jesus
would not have been fulfilled. For, as Jesus also says, “How then will the
Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?” (Genesis 26:54 AMP)
Things had to happen in a certain way so that the plans that God the Father in
Heaven had for Jesus would be fulfilled. In essence, Jesus understood that the
accusations of Him leading an insurrection resulted in His persecution as well
as His crucifixion and ultimately His resurrection. Therefore, if God the Father
in Heaven intervened and prevented certain things from happening in Jesus’ life,
then God the Father in Heaven would also be intervening and preventing His plans
for Jesus from being fulfilled. Jesus understood these things with foresight as
opposed to knowing these things in hindsight like Joseph because He cultivated a
relationship with God the Father in Heaven. And through time spent praying and
communing with God the Father in Heaven, Jesus was able to gain foresight into
what is to come. Similarly to Jesus, you may cultivate a relationship with God
the Father in Heaven. And through communing as well as praying to God the Father
in Heaven, you may gain foresight into what is to come in your life. With this
foresight, you too may realize that God the Father in Heaven could intervene and
prevent others from condemning and imprisoning you due to the misconstrued words
that others attributed to you. However, if God the Father in Heaven did that, He
would be intervening and preventing His plans for your life from being
fulfilled. So, while it may not be pleasant to experience being condemned and
imprisoned by the people of this world because of the misconstrued words that
others attribute to you, just believe and know with certainty in your heart that
this has taken place so that the plans that God the Father in Heaven has for you
shall be fulfilled.</p>

<p>God bless.</p>
