        "content_text":"Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. So now, send word, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every person and animal that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die. Exodus 9:18-19 NASB Pharoah was told in advance about what was to come. Pharaoh could have ignored this warning because of lack of belief in the words that he was told. Likewise, Pharoah could have decided to not say anything to those who were still in the field because of indifference toward their lives. Pharoah could have thought to himself, “As long as I survive what is to come, that is all that matters. What happens to other people is not my concern.” In fact, some time before he was forewarned about the devastating hail that was to come, Pharaoh was told in advance about a plague that will fall upon the land of Egypt. The Lord said to Pharoah: If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, the hand of the Lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats (Exodus 9:2-3,5 NIV). Pharoah may not have bothered to warn others of the pestilence that was to come. As such, when the Lord did just as he had said the next morning, all the livestock of the Egyptians died (Exodus 9:6). Like Pharoah, you may know about what is to come. And like Pharoah, you may decide to not say anything to those (unbelievers) who are still in the field because of indifference to their lives. Like Pharoah, you may think, “As long as my life is secure, that is all that matters. Whatever happens to others is not my concern.” But that should not be! Instead, you should share the Word of God to others so that they may come to believe in Jesus Christ. Of course, not everyone whom you share the Word of God to shall believe you. Some shall come to believe in Jesus Christ when you share the Word of God with them; others shall not. That is out of your control. All you can do is share the Word of God to others and let them decide on whether or not to believe. In that sense, it is not too different from what happened when Pharaoh sent word to those in the field about the hail that was to come. Whoever feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses, but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the Lord left his slaves and his livestock in the field (Exodus 9:20-21 ESV). Some believed and hurried their livestock to safety whilst others did not believe and left the livestock out in the field. Each person in the field made their own choice on what to do after hearing the word that Pharoah shared to them. Therefore, send word! Share the Word of God to others; and they shall ultimately decide whether or not to believe in Jesus Christ and secure eternal life in heaven. God bless.","summary":"Send word!

        "content_text":"As it was mentioned in the previous message, people can learn to live with the fears and challenges in one’s life by avoiding to deal with them rather than confronting them. But as it was mentioned in the previous post, Jesus can remove the obstacles and challenges in your life that you live with and avoid confronting because of fear. With Jesus, you do not have to fear the challenges / obstacles that block your path. With Jesus, you can have the courage to confront those obstacles. Because with Jesus, you can have confidence that those challenges and obstacles that block your path shall go from you and perish and be removed and cease to exist. Such a situation happened to Jesus’ disciples one day. One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.” So they set out, and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger (Luke 8:22-23 ESV). Jesus’ disciples went sailing from their current position in life to their destination across the lake. Whilst on their journey, they encountered a stormy situation in their life. Like the people in the city where the demon-possessed man lived in the tombs, Jesus’ disciples could have learned to live with the stormy situation in their life. But they did not. Instead, they went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm (Luke 8:24 ESV). Yes, the disciples told Jesus about the stormy situation that they were in; and Jesus made the stormy situation in their life cease to exist so that calm and peace was restored in their life. Likewise, you may be in the midst of a stormy situation in your life. Well, like the disciples, you too may tell Jesus about the stormy situation in your life. And like the storm that was rocking the boat that the disciples were in, Jesus may also make the stormy situation in your life cease to exist so that there is calm in your life. And of course Jesus can also calm the storms that exist in society. Storms such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Storms such as the wildfires raging across America. Storms such as the protests and counter-protests due to systemic racial inequality. And the like. You can tell Jesus about these storms; and Jesus can make them cease to exist so that calm and peace is restored in your community, your city, society. It can feel like Jesus is not there to help you through the storms. It can feel like Jesus is asleep at the wheel while storms are raging all around you. That may have been what Jesus disciples felt. Jesus was asleep whilst the storm was raging all around them. Therefore, it may have felt like Jesus wouldn’t do anything to help them whilst they were in the midst of the storms that they were experiencing in life. Instead, it may have felt like Jesus would allow them to succumb to the storms in their life. But that is not true. What Jesus wanted His disciples to know was that there was no reason to panic or be afraid whilst amidst the storms in their life. After He made the storm cease to exist in their life, He said to them, “Where is your faith?” And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?” (Luke 8:25 ESV) He was saying that you should not just be calm before the storm. Instead, you should also be calm whilst you are amidst the storm because you should have faith that Jesus is able and willing to make storms in your life cease to exist. Likewise, you do not need to panic or be fearful of the stormy situations that exist in your life or your community. Whether it be the Covid-19 pandemic or the wildfires or the racial tension raging in your community or some other storm in your personal life, there is no need to panic or be afraid. Instead, you need to have faith. Faith that Jesus will calm the storm in your life so that they cease to exist. Just believe. God bless.","summary":"You should also be calm whilst you are amidst the storm because you should have faith that Jesus is able and willing to make storms in your life cease to exist.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/93406535-e4a6b900-f85d-11ea-8330-ca8eaed250ac.jpg","date_published": "2020-09-23T00:00:00+00:00",

        "title":"Pass That Way",
        "content_text":"When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way. Matthew 8:28 NKJV There were two demon-possessed men who lived amongst the tombs; and because of this, no one could pass through that area lest they be met by them. Likewise, there can be challenges / obstacles in one’s life that can prevent you from going down a certain path in life. And instead of attempting to confront or overcome those challenges and obstacles in one’s life, you instead try to avoid them and learn to live with them. That is what the people of the Gergesenes did with the two demon-possessed men. Rather than confronting and overcoming this challenge / obstacle that lived amongst the tombs and prevented them from going down the path, they avoided that area and learned to live with that obstacle in life. From an individual standpoint, anything that you fear can stop you from going down a certain path in life; and instead of trying to confront or overcome those fears and obstacles, you learn to live with it and avoid things that may require you to face your fears. For example, fears of social situations may cause you to avoid going out and meeting new people. Fears of failure may cause you to not even try to do something. And from a societal level, fear of racial profiling or discrimination can cause certain people to refrain from going in or through certain neighbourhoods. But fear not, for Jesus can remove those obstacles from your midst. That is what happened with the two demon-possessed men. He said to them, “Go!” So they came out [of the men] and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water (Matthew 8:32 AMP). Yes, Jesus confronted and removed the obstacles that caused people to avoid that area. Likewise, Jesus can also remove the obstacles and challenges in your life that you live with and avoid confronting because of fear. With Jesus, you do not have to fear the challenges / obstacles that block your path. With Jesus, you can have the courage to confront those obstacles. Because with Jesus, you can have confidence that those challenges and obstacles that block your path shall go from you and perish and be removed and cease to exist. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region. Matthew 8:34 NIV Jesus was at the place where the two demon-possessed men used to terrorise the people. And yet the whole city came out to meet Him. In other words, the people went to the area that they used to avoid because of the two demon-possessed men. Because of Jesus, the people were able to walk down the path that contained the obstacle that they used to avoid. Likewise, Jesus can remove the roadblocks that stop you from going down certain paths in life. And because of Jesus, you too can go down paths that used to contain obstacles that you used to avoid. Just believe. God bless.","summary":"Jesus can remove the roadblocks that stop you from going down certain paths in life.

        "content_text":"We can only feel the tremor; we do not see the inner tension (of the tectonic plates) that cause the tremor. This inner tension can build up over a long period of time and release itself in the form of an earthquake. The earthquake is just a by-product of this inner tension being released after a period of time building, grinding, and finally breaking up underneath the surface of the earth. We can only see the eruption; we do not see the inner turmoil boiling within (the volcano) that cause the eruption. This inner turmoil can build up over a long period of time before releasing itself in the form of a volcanic eruption. The volcanic eruption is just a by-product of this turmoil being released after a period of time building, seething, and finally erupting forth from within the volcano. It is the same with people who erupt at others. It may be a by-product of that which we do not see or know—the inner tensions of that person’s life grinding beneath the surface of the facade that we do see and the inner turmoils of that person’s life seething within them. After a period of time of being built up within a person, you may see this person’s inner tensions and turmoils released whilst around you in the form of angry outbursts, an eruption of words spewing forth toward you, and other types of destructive behaviours that breaks and shakes the calm and peaceful atmosphere that was present just moments ago. Of course, this is not limited to the individual level; these tremors and eruptions may also happen at the communal or societal level. In fact, you can see such eruptions happening across America. For, as mentioned in the previous message, Martin Luther King Jr. had “a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’” so that his “four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” However, as current events in America can attest, Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream has not yet been realized. This racial tension has been building up in America (and elsewhere) for many generations. This racial inequality has been grinding and causing friction for many generations. For a long period of time, a certain people have been seething with indignation at the racial injustices that they have faced and experienced. So the eruptions (protests) that you see happening across America (and elsewhere) is just a by-product of this inner tension and turmoil that is being released after building up for a long period of time within society. When a person unexpectedly erupts and spews words toward you, just realize that is a symptom of an underlying cause, similarly to how fevers, coughs, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, and the like, may be symptoms to an underlying illness such as Covid-19. You may try to treat the symptoms but that does not resolve the underlying illness that caused those symptoms in the first place. Similarly, the protests happening around America (and elsewhere) are just a symptom of an underlying social illness—racial inequality. You can try to treat the symptoms by setting curfews or bringing in more law enforcement officers to quell the unrest but that does not fix the underlying societal ills that cause those symptoms in the first place. Without a remedy, contagious diseases like Covid-19 may continue to infect people of this world. And without collective action, people who are ill with a contagious virus like Covid-19 may spread the virus to others, thereby causing the illness to spread within their community or society. It can be the same with societal ills. Without a remedy, societal ills like racial inequality may continue to infect people of this world. Without collective action, people who are ill with a contagious disease—like hatred toward other races or beliefs that you are superior to other races—may spread those diseased points of views to others, thereby causing the illness to spread within their community or society. Because of the collective action of the people around the world—like shutting down non-essential services, social distancing, refraining from going out unless absolutely necessary, and wearing face masks when you do go out in public, and the like—countries have been able to either eliminate the contagious disease Covid-19 or flatten the curve. New Zealand was one of the countries that was able to halt the spread of Covid-19. This was done by making halting the spread of Covid-19 a top priority. And this was made a top priority because halting the spread of Covid-19 was identified as desirable for the greater good of society. For, as mentioned in a previous post, we are called to live for a higher purpose than just ourselves. We are called to live to be a benefit/blessing to others in the community, city, province/state, and country that they live in. New Zealanders decided to live for a higher purpose than themselves. New Zealanders chose to live for the benefit of others in their community, city, and country. Because of this collective and sustained effort and vigilance by the citizens of New Zealand, they were able to halt the spread of Covid-19. However, if people within a community or country stop working together before the disease has been eliminated from said community or country, then the disease may flare up again and continue to spread to others within the community or country rather than be eliminated. And if people within a community or country think that other things should take priority over halting the spread of the disease, then the disease may flare up again and continue to spread to other people within the community or country rather than be eliminated. This scenario is happening in countries such as America. Likewise, it can take the collective action of the people within a community or a country to eliminate societal diseases such as racial inequality. But it has to be a top priority of that community or country. The people of that community or country must also believe that it is for the greater good of society to eliminate that societal disease. The people of that community or country must be willing to do things for the collective benefit of others ahead of the benefit of just themselves and their kind. However, if the people within a community or country decide to put themselves ahead of the collective benefit of others, then the spread of the societal disease shall continue unabated. As well, if the people within a community or country stop working collectively before the societal illness has been eliminated, then the societal illness may flare up again and continue to spread to others. Like New Zealand’s response to Covid-19, elimination of societal illnesses requires collective will, sustained effort, and vigilance by the government and citizens of the community or country. On the other hand, societal illnesses shall continue to spread within a community or country if they follow a similar path to America’s response to Covid-19. When a person experienced the symptoms associated with Covid-19, they would go to the hospital to get tested and, if necessary, get treatment. Hospitals—and the doctors and nurses and other essential workers who worked there—were at the forefront of the community’s response to eliminating the disease. Doctors and nurses and other essential workers were willing to work for the collective benefit of others within their community; they put other people’s benefit ahead of their own. At the very least, others ought to be willing to do the same. However, as you can see in countries like America, some people are not willing to do that. This selfishness—putting self ahead of others— can be a symptom of an individual’s diseased soul. At the societal level, the selfishness of putting one race above another can be symptom of a societal illness. Like doctors and nurses and other essential workers, there must be workers who may treat those who show symptoms of societal illness. Symptoms like hatred toward other races or beliefs of superiority over other races. The workers who treat the symptoms of societal illnesses may work in a kind of hospital—a hospital for the soul, the church. For, as Jesus said to the scribes and Pharisees who criticized Him eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners: “Healthy people don’t need a doctor; those who are sick do. I’ve come to call sinners to change the way they think and act, not to call people who think they have God’s approval” (Luke 5:31-32 GW). Yes, church and its workers ought to be at the forefront of a community’s response to treating and eliminating societal illnesses like how hospitals and its workers are at the forefront of a community’s reponse to treating and eliminating diseases like Covid-19. For, if the church and its workers are not willing to be at the forefront, then societal illnesses may continue to spread unabated rather than be halted and eliminated. God bless.","summary":"Churches and its workers ought to be at the frontlines treating and eliminating societal illnesses like how hospitals and its workers are at the frontlines treating and eliminating diseases like Covid-19.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/86523075-cde2ef80-be34-11ea-89cb-3158788ecbfa.jpg","date_published": "2020-07-08T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"God said, “Take now your son, your only son [of promise], whom you love, Isaac, and go to the region of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”Genesis 22:2 AMP God instructed Abraham to take his son, Isaac, to the region of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains. Now, as mentioned in previous posts, God can instruct you to go to a particular destination (as well as take a particular route to said destination). In a previous post, Peter was instructed by the Holy Spirit to go to Caesarea and speak with a man named Cornelius. In another post, Jesus had to go through Samaria to travel to Galilee. And in yet another post, a prophet named Samuel instructed Saul to take a specific route back to his father’s home. Those posts suggested that you follow the instructions of the Lord by faith and without hesitation. So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and then he got up and went to the place of which God had told him. And on the third day [of travel] Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance (Genesis 22:3-4 AMP). Abraham traveled for about three days to get to the place that God instructed him to go. Likewise, the people from the stories in the previous posts—Peter, Jesus, and Saul—traveled certain distances and lengths of time to get to the place that the Holy Spirit instructed them to go. This time between when the Holy Spirit instructs you to go somewhere to do something and when you get to that somewhere provides a perfect opportunity for the serpent to introduce doubt in your heart. As mentioned in that post, the serpent can do that by getting you to question whether or not God really said what we think He said. As such, while Abraham (or we) travel to the place that the Lord instructed us to go, Abraham (or we) may wonder whether it was God’s voice that we heard speaking to us or if it was just our inner voice and imaginations. And if the serpent is successful in introducing this doubt into our hearts, then we may abandon our journey to the destination and instead turn around and go back. But that ought not to be! Instead, like Abraham, we should not waver in our belief in what the Lord had told us and continue marching forward until we reach the place that the Lord instructed us to go. Therefore, as it was mentioned in that post, we must realize when the serpent is trying to use this tactic against us so that we may guard against falling for this tactic of his. We should also have the same mindset and thought process that Abraham had. Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead (Hebrews 11:19 NLT). Abraham thought that nothing is impossible for God. And Abraham reasoned that God is faithful—He keeps His promises because God is not a liar. (One of God’s promises to Abraham required Isaac to grow up and marry someone and start a family, which would be difficult to do if he were dead. Therefore, Abraham reasoned that God would be able to bring his son back from the dead.) Likewise, we should think that nothing is impossible for God. And we should reason that God is faithful, that He shall keep His promises to us because He is not a liar. Of course, as mentioned in this post, the serpent may try to get you to doubt the veracity of what God told you. Whilst you are journeying to where the Lord told you to go, the serpent may try to get you to doubt the faithfulness of the Lord as well as His ability to keep His promises. And if the serpent is successful in introducing this doubt into our hearts, we may abandon our journey to the destination and instead turn around and go back. But that ought not to be! Instead, like Abraham, we should not waver in our belief in God’s faithfulness and abilities. Thus, as it was mentioned in that post, we must realize when the serpent is trying to use this tactic against us so that we may guard against falling for this tactic of his. All these people died having faith. They didn’t receive the things that God had promised them, but they saw these things coming in the distant future and rejoiced. They acknowledged that they were living as strangers with no permanent home on earth.Hebrews 11:13 GW God keeps His promises, but that does not mean that those promises of His shall be fulfilled within your lifetime. Rather, some of the promises that God tells you may be fulfilled within the lifetime of future generations. You may think of these as generational promises. Some of the things that God promised to Abraham did not happen within his lifetime; rather, they happened in future generations. An analogy can be found in the current events that are happening around the world. A certain person had a dream: “A dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’” so that his “four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” As current events can attest, Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream was not fulfilled within his lifetime, but that does that mean that his dream shall never be fulfilled. Rather, that dream of his may be fulfilled within the lifetime of future generations, maybe even within the lifetime of this generation. Therefore, you should not lose hope or faith in God just because you do not see His promises or your dreams come to pass within your lifetime. Rather, similarly to Abraham, you should rejoice because of your belief that His promises and your dreams shall come to pass in future generations. And similarly to Abraham, you should share with your children the promises that God has made to you so that they and future generations may also rejoice and know what is to come in their lifetimes or the lifetimes of their descendents. God bless.","summary":"God keeps His promises, but that does not mean they shall be fulfilled within your lifetime.

        "content_text":"A man named Cornelius lived in the city of Caesarea. He was a Roman army officer in the Italian Regiment. One day, about three in the afternoon, he had a vision. He clearly saw an angel from God come to him and say, “Cornelius! Send messengers now to the city of Joppa, and summon a man whose name is Simon Peter. He is a guest of Simon, a leatherworker, whose house is by the sea.” Acts 10:1,3,5,6 GW There was a man named Cornelius. God dispatched an angel to tell him to send people to the city of Joppa to summon a man named Simon Peter. The angel of God gave Cornelius specific instructions to follow. As mentioned in a previous post, the Lord can give you specific instructions to follow. He may give you these instructions directly as you pray to Him. Or, He may give you these directions through men and women of God (such as prophets), as was the case in that previous post. Or, as is the case in this story, He may send angels to deliver His instructions. And as suggested in that previous post, you should follow the instructions that the Lord gives you (whether it be directly through your prayer time with Him or indirectly through prophets) lest you miss the connections that the Lord has planned for you. Cornelius decided to listen to and follow the instructions that the angel of God gave to him. For, when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. So when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa (Acts 10:7-8 NKJV). When you follow the instructions of the Lord, He shall make sure that what He says comes true since the Lord does not lie; He is a faithful God. When you do your part by obediently following and acting upon His word, the Lord will do His part to honor your faith so that His word comes to pass and bears fruit. That is what happened when Cornelius decided to follow the instructions that the angel of God gave to him. Around noon the next day, while Cornelius’ men were on their way and coming close to Joppa, Peter went on the roof to pray. He became hungry and wanted to eat. While the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance. He saw the sky open and something like a large linen sheet being lowered by its four corners to the ground. This happened three times. Then the sheet was quickly taken into the sky.Acts 10:9,10,11,16 GW Around noon, while the messengers that Cornelius sent were nearing Joppa, Simon Peter went to pray on the roof of the house that he was lodging at. Whilst praying, he became hungry and wanted to eat; but the food that was being prepared was not ready. Whilst the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance. Now, this is reminiscent of the story of Jesus’ encounter with the woman at the well that was mentioned in the previous post. As mentioned in that story, Jesus arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, tired as He was from His journey, sat down by the well. It was then about the sixth hour (noon) (John 4:5-6 AMP). Jesus arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar and sat down by Jacob’s well at around noon, after a long walk from Judea. This is the same time that Simon Peter went on the roof to pray. Jesus was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food (John 4:8 NLT). Jesus was waiting alone at the well whilst food was being bought for Him by His disciples. Simon Peter was praying alone whilst food was being prepared for him by his host. Whilst waiting alone at the well, a Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink” (John 4:7 NLT). While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three men are looking for you. So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them” (Acts 10:19-20 NIV). The Lord spoke with Simon Peter and told him to go with the men who were seeking him so that Cornelius’ decision to faithfully follow and obey the instructions that the Lord gave to him would bear fruit. Jesus was tired and weary from His journey, so He could have ignored the woman who came to the well to draw water. He could have sat there and just waited for His disciples to come back with food. But He did not. Instead, He chose to speak with that woman. Likewise, Simon Peter was hungry, so he could have ignored the messengers who came to see him. He could have just sat there on the roof of the house that he was lodging at and waited for the food that was being prepared to be ready. But he did not. Instead, Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why have you come?” (Acts 10:21 NIV). Likewise, many times the Lord may tell you to do something when you prefer to be doing something else. Like Jesus, the Holy Spirit may tell you to speak to someone when you prefer to rest because you are tired and weary. The Holy Spirit told Jesus to speak to the woman who walked toward Him at the well. Likewise, the Holy Spirit may tell you to talk to someone that walks or stands or sits by you when you prefer to just sit or stand on the subway or bus with your earphones on listening to music whilst on the way to school or work. Or, like Simon Peter, the Holy Spirit may tell you to go and speak with someone when you prefer to eat because you are hungry. Yes, the Holy Spirit may tell you to speak to someone whilst waiting in line to order lunch or sitting at your table while the meal that you ordered at a restaurant is being prepared. Or, the Holy Spirit may tell you to go and spend some time with a person or group of people when you prefer to spend some time with your family, friends, or partner. When such a scenario happens, you have a choice to make: do what the Lord wants you to do, or do what you want to do. I suggest that you do what the Lord wants to do. For, when you do your part by obediently following and acting upon His word, the Lord will do His part to honor your faith such that His word comes to pass and bears fruit. You may not fully understand why the Lord wants you to do or say something to someone. That is okay. You don’t have to understand why He wants you to do or say that something. You just have to trust in Him. For, as the Holy Spirit said to Simon Peter: do not hesitate. Do not hesitate to do what the Lord tells you to do. Do not doubt or question why the Lord is telling you to do or say something. All you have to do is do what the Lord tells you to do, without hesitation or doubt, but by faith. And when you do that, you shall see your obedient actions to His words bear fruit. Jesus decided to do what the the Lord wanted Him to do; and as mentioned in the previous post, the woman He encountered at the well, and many other people in Samaria, came to believe in Him after hearing the woman and Him speak to them. Likewise, Simon Peter chose to do what the Lord wanted Him to do. Simon Peter decided to go with the messengers back to Cornelius’ home. On the following day he [and the others] entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends (Acts 10:24 AMP). Cornelius vouched for Simon Peter—the man of God that an angel instructed him to summon—to his relatives and close friends. Because Cornelius vouched for Simon Peter, Cornelius’ relatives and close friends also came to hear what this man of God had to say. Now, this is similar to what the woman at the well from the previous post did. The woman vouched for Jesus and told the people of her village to come and see and hear what He had to say. And as mentioned in another post, it is also similar to what Saul’s servant did. Saul’s servant vouched for a man of God—Samuel the Prophet—suggesting that they go and see him and hear what he has to say. And as mentioned in the previous post, you ought to vouch for the men and women of God whom you view as credible to other people so that they go and see them and hear what they have to say. Cornelius vouched to his relatives and close friends. You can do likewise with your relatives and close friends. Saul’s servant vouched to his boss. You can do likewise with your bosses, managers, and colleagues. The woman at the well vouched to acquaintances and strangers whom she did not know. You can do likewise with people whom you do not know (well). The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) John 4:9 NIV Peter told them, “You know it is against our laws for a Jewish man to enter a Gentile home like this or to associate with you. But God has shown me that I should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean. So I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. Now tell me why you sent for me.” Acts 10:28-29 NLT At the time, Jews did not associate with Samaritans. Nevertheless, Jesus, a Jew, spoke with a Samaritan woman; and subsequently spoke to other Samaritans in the town of Sychar. At the time, it was against the law for Jews to associate with or visit Gentiles. Nevertheless, Simon Peter came without hesitation to Cornelius’ home and spoke with the people gathered there. Likewise, you may think that you ought to shun rather than associate with a person or group of people for some particular reason. Now, some of those reasons were mentioned in previous posts. For example, a previous post mentioned that you may think that you should shun rather than associate with those whom you view as wicked. Another post suggested that you may think that you should shun rather than associate with those who do or say things that you do not endorse or agree with. For example, you may think that you should shun rather than associate with those who have different political views or sexual preferences or religious beliefs. But that should not be! Instead, you should follow the example that Jesus and Simon Peter set. Like Jesus, you should be willing to associate with those whom others do not associate with. At that time, Jews and Samaritans had differing religious beliefs. For, as the woman at the well said to Jesus, “Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem” (John 4:20 NIV). Likewise, He may not have agreed with the fact that the woman was living with a man who was not her husband. And yet, that did not stop Him from speaking with her instead of shunning her for her choices. And like Simon Peter, you should not be hesitant to go and associate with those whom others do not associate with. You should not raise any objection when the Lord tells you to associate with people whom others would shun. Rather, you should go by faith. And when you do that, you shall see your obedient action to His instructions bear fruit. That is what happened with Simon Peter. Simon Peter decided to go with the messengers back to Cornelius’ home; and he spoke to those who were gathered at Cornelius’ home. And while Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who were listening to the message [confirming God’s acceptance of Gentiles] (Acts 10:44 AMP). And the Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles, too (Acts 10:45 NLT). Simon Peter was willing to go and associate with them—Gentiles—because God showed him that he should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean. Likewise, you too should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean just because you do not agree or endorse their actions, lifestyle, or views. Rather, like Simon Peter, you too ought to be willing to go and associate with them. And when you do that, you too may see the Holy Spirit poured out on them. But this does not happen if you refuse to associate with others because you judge them to be impure or unclean. (It is of course possible that you do not care about others, such as those whom you disagree with or view as wicked. Well, as mentioned in a previous post, whilst you may not care about others and their eternal destiny, the Lord cares about all—including those whom people view as wicked. As such, you should put aside your personal misgivings and go without doubt and hesitation to those whom you would not normally associate with.) As it was mentioned in the previous post, Jesus said to the woman at the well: “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water” (John 4:10 NASB). For, “whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life” (John 4:14 NIV). This living water—the Holy Spirit—is not only available to Jews; it is available to all. Jesus said this to a Samaritan woman. Thus, if she asked Jesus for this living water, then she would receive it! And this living water was available to the Gentiles who gathered at Cornelius’ home. And it is also available to those whom you would shun rather than associate with because you judge them to be wicked or impure. Therefore, go to those whom the Lord tells you to go to and speak to. Even if they are people whom you would not normally associate with for whatever reason. And when you do that, you will see your obedient actions done by faith bear fruit. You will see the Spirit of God pour out on those whom you did not expect would be poured out to. You will see people whom you would least expect receive the Holy Spirit similarly to how people did not expect to see Saul prophesying after the Holy Spirit was poured out onto him and similarly to how the Jews were amazed because they did not expect the Holy Spirit to be poured out onto the Gentiles. So just believe. And go, without hesitations or doubts, but by faith. God bless.","summary":"For, when you do your part by obediently following and acting upon His word, the Lord will do His part to honor your faith so that His word comes to pass and bears fruit.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/81978253-3f52ae80-95f9-11ea-92ab-8506622ca7c5.jpg","date_published": "2020-05-14T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"The woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the village, telling everyone, “Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could he possibly be the Messiah?” John 4:28-29 NLT The servant said to him, “Look here, in this city there is a man of God, and the man is held in honor; everything that he says comes true. Now let us go there; perhaps he can advise us about our journey [and tell us where we should go].” 1 Samuel 9:6 AMP The woman told everyone in her village to come see a man who told her everything she ever did. For, while speaking with the man, she mentioned that she doesn’t have a husband. To which, Jesus said to her, “You have correctly said, ‘I do not have a husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. You have said this truthfully.” So the woman said to Him, “Sir, I see that You are a prophet” (John 4:17-19 AMP). They had just met but Jesus knew these details about her. Astounded by the conversation that they had, the woman left her water jar beside the well, ran back to the village, and told everyone to come see a man—Jesus—whom they did not personally know. Now, if you recall, this isn’t that different from the story of Saul’s search for his father’s missing donkeys that was mentioned in the previous message. In the previous post, Saul’s servant told him to go see a man of God—Samuel the Prophet—whom he did not personally know. Then Saul said to his servant, “Your suggestion is a good one. Come, let us go.” And they went to the town where the man of God was (1 Samuel 9:10 LEB). Whilst conversing, Samuel the Prophet told Saul: As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found (1 Samuel 9:20 NIV). They had just met but Samuel the Prophet knew those details about his life. Saul had not met Samuel the Prophet before. We know this because Saul approached Samuel inside the gateway and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is” (1 Samuel 9:18 GW). Saul did not know that he was speaking to the seer—Samuel the Prophet—whom he was looking for because they had never met before! Now, Saul agreed to go and see this man of God because his servant had vouched for him. The servant told Saul the man of God is highly respected by all; and he is credible because everything he says comes true. This is not too different from what the woman told people in her village. The woman vouched for the man of God whom she just met at the well. The woman told the people of her village that everything Jesus said to me is true. Even though the woman just met Jesus at the well, she testified that He told her all that she ever did. So the people came streaming from the village to see him (John 4:30 NLT). Now, you might know men and women of God—such as prophets—whom you view as being highly respected and credible. You may view the man or woman of God as honorable and credible because that is the reputation that they have built. Or you may hold those views of the man or woman of God because of your (or someone you trust’s) personal experiences and encounters with them; and during your personal encounters with the man or woman of God, they told you things from your past and/or told you things that came to pass in the future. As such, like Saul’s servant and the woman at the well, you should vouch for the men and women of God whom you know and see as credible. Others might not know these men and women of God. But you do, through your personal experiences and encounters with them. As such, you may testify to the credibility of these men and women of God and share your personal experiences with them to those who do not know them. If you do not vouch for these men and women of God, then others may not go to see them. And if they do not go to see them, they may not get the opportunity to experience what you experienced when you encountered the man or woman of God. And what you experienced may have been profound and life-changing. Thus, like Saul’s servant and the woman at the well, you should vouch for the men and women of God whom you view as credible and recommend others to go and see them so that they too may have profound and life-changing experiences and encounters with them; and be blessed by them. That is what happened to Saul, as mentioned in the previous post. But that does not happen if Saul’s servant does not vouch for the man of God and suggest that he go and see him. Likewise, the people of the village would not have profound experience if the woman at the well did not vouch for Jesus and recommend that they go and see him. And that is what happened. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. And because of his words many more became believers. They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world” (John 4:39-42 NIV). Many believed because of the woman’s testimony. And many more believed after hearing directly from Him. Yes, as seen in these stories, there are multitude of ways for a person to come to believe in Him. A person may come to believe in Jesus after hearing your testimony. A person may also come to believe in Him through men and women of God whom you recommend that they go see. A person may come to believe in Jesus after hearing directly from Him. Or, as Jesus said to someone: “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe” (John 4:48 NKJV). Yes, not everyone in the village believed in Jesus after hearing the woman’s testimony; they only believed in Him after they themselves heard Him directly. Likewise, not everyone shall believe in Jesus after hearing your testimony. Instead, they may need to hear directly from Jesus or from men and women of God before believing in Him. And some people will only believe in Jesus after seeing signs and wonders. (Of course, Jesus desires everyone to believe in Him and be saved, so you should use every tool in your toolbox to reach each person. Thus, if your testimony will convince them to believe in Him, then you should share your testimony with them. Or, if asking a person to go and hear from a man or woman of God will convince a person to believe in Jesus, then you should do that. If signs and wonders will convince a person to believe in Jesus, then you should do that. And the like.) As mentioned in the previous post, Samuel the Prophet told Saul all of the signs that he would see if he took a particular route back to his father’s house. He told Saul that he would meet two people by Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah who will tell you that the donkey’s that you have been looking for have been found. He then told Saul that he would meet three men by the big oak tree in Tabor who would greet him and give him two loaves of bread. And then he told Saul that he would meet a group of prophets and worshippers at Gibeah, where the Spirit of the Lord would come upon him; and he shall prophesy with them and be changed into a new person. Then it happened. As Saul turned and started to leave, God gave him a new heart, and all Samuel’s signs were fulfilled that day (1 Samuel 10:9 NLT). Yes, Saul went to see and hear from a man of God; and he witnessed signs come to pass, which had a profound effect on his life. Likewise, men and women of God shall witness signs and wonders come to pass when they follow the Lord’s direction. Before Jesus came to Samaria, He was in Judea. He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. But He needed to go through Samaria (John 4:3-4 NKJV). Now, to be clear: Jesus did not have to go through Samaria to go back to Galilee. At the time, there were more than one route from Judea to Galilee. He could have taken a different route back to Galilee from Judea. But it says He needed to go through Samaria because the Holy Spirit instructed Him to take a specific route—Judea to Galilee via Samaria—for a reason: so the people of that city would come to believe in Him and be saved. The Lord knew the people of that city were ready and receptive to hearing the Good News of Jesus Christ. So the Lord sent Jesus there to share the Gospel with them. And as it was mentioned earlier, many of the Samaritans of that city decided to believe in Him because of the testimony of the woman and the word that He shared with them. However, this does not happen if Jesus takes a different route back to Galilee from Judea. This only happened because Jesus chose to follow the instructions of the Lord by going through Samaria whilst on the way back to Galilee from Judea. Do you think the work of harvesting will not begin until the summer ends four months from now? Look around you! Vast fields of human souls are ripening all around us, and are ready now for reaping. John 4:35 TLB Men and women of God: Look all around you. The field of human souls is ready for reaping. You do not have to wait for some future time or season or event before reaping. The field is ready now. Some are waiting expectantly for a so-called Third Pentecost where they envision a great outpouring of His Spirit and reaping of souls. You do not have to wait for such a time. No! The field is ready now. You can witness His Spirit being poured out on people now. What did Jesus say to the woman at the well (besides the number of husbands that she’s had)? Jesus said to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water” (John 4:10 NASB). For, “whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life” (John 4:14 NIV). He is talking about the Spirit of God. That is the living water that He mentions. And as He said to her, all you have to do is ask Him (by faith) and He will give you living water—the Spirit of God. Now, He also spoke of this living water to others. To others, He said: Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them. By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive.” (John 7:38-39 NIV). The Spirit of God shall come upon whoever believes in Him. So you do not have to wait until some future time or season or event before seeing the Spirit of God come upon people. Instead, you need to go out into the field and reap. For the field is ready for reaping. And you do that by testifying to others, similarly to what the woman at the well did; you do that by bringing people to Jesus; and you do that by suggesting people go see men and women of God, similarly to what Saul’s servant did. And the like. When you do that, you shall witness people believe in Him; and consequently, you shall witness the Spirit of God come upon them. Just believe. God bless.","summary":"You should vouch for the men and women of God whom you view as credible and suggest others to go and see them so that they may have profound and life-changing experiences and encounters with them.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/80776824-42e23200-8b31-11ea-86fe-8de7609348c7.jpg","date_published": "2020-04-30T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"Love never fails [it never fades nor ends]. But as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for the gift of special knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part [for our knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete]. 1 Corinthians 13:8-9 AMP Love never comes to an end. There is the gift of speaking what God has revealed, but it will no longer be used. There is the gift of speaking in other languages, but it will stop by itself. There is the gift of knowledge, but it will no longer be used. Our knowledge is incomplete and our ability to speak what God has revealed is incomplete. 1 Corinthians 13:8-9 GW As mentioned in the previous post, the Lord knows better than you and your circle of family, friends, confidantes, et al. about you and the direction that you should go in your life. And that is because the guidance and advice that other people give to you is limited by their knowledge. For, as it is written in the Scripture quoted above, our knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete. We only know in part, so we can only prophesy in part. This is because we can only speak of what we know. And what we know is incomplete and partial. This is why the messages that are shared here may seem incomplete. It is because the Lord has only revealed a fragment of the whole picture. A piece of the whole puzzle. And this portion of the whole puzzle is all that I can share since that is all that the Lord has shared to me. It is also why subsequent posts may build upon previous messages. It is because the Lord reveals a new fragment/piece of the puzzle that connects with what He has previously revealed. After this I will pour out My Spirit on all humanity; then your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions. Joel 2:28 HCSB This gift of prophecy is not limited to a select few. In fact, as it is written in the Scripture that is quoted above, there shall be a time when the Lord pours out His Spirit on all people; your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, and your young men will see visions. A preview of this time may be seen in the story of Saul. (Yes, the same Saul whom a prophet named Samuel anointed to be king over the people of Israel because they demanded that a king—instead of the Lord—lead them and fight their battles and save them from their troubles.) After Samuel the Prophet anointed Saul as king over the people of Israel, Samuel the Prophet told Saul: When you leave me today, you’ll meet two men near Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They’ll tell you, “The donkeys you’ve been looking for have been found (1 Samuel 10:2 CEV). Go on from there until you reach the big oak tree at Tabor, where you’ll meet three men on their way to worship God at Bethel (1 Samuel 10:3 CEV). After they greet you, they’ll give you two loaves of bread (1 Samuel 10:4 CEV). Next, go to Gibeah, where the Philistines have an army camp. As you’re going into the town, you’ll meet a group of prophets coming down from the place of worship. They’ll be going along prophesying while others are walking in front of them, playing small harps, small drums, and flutes (1 Samuel 10:5 CEV). At that time the Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person (1 Samuel 10:5 NLT). Samuel the Prophet gave Saul specific directions as to which route/path to follow to travel back to his father’s home. Samuel the Prophet told Saul to go to Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah, where he will meet two men. Then Samuel the Prophet told Saul to go to the big tree at Tabor, where he will meet three men who will greet him and give him two loaves of bread. And finally, Samuel the Prophet told Saul to go to Gibeah, where he will meet a group of prophets and worshippers. As is mentioned in the previous post, Lord knows best which direction/route you should take to get to your destination because He is all-knowing. He knows what will happen when you take a certain route. And He knows whether or not you will cross paths with obstacles and/or dead ends along the route. He knows whom and what you will encounter along the way. And He knows exactly where you shall come across these obstacles and people along your journey. Because He is all-seeing. That is why Samuel the Prophet was able to give Saul such detailed information regarding whom he would encounter (and where) along the way back to his father’s home. It is because the Lord revealed those specific details to Samuel so that he would relay that information to Saul. As mentioned in the previous post, whether or not you follow the directions that the Lord advise you to go is ultimately up to you. You may choose to follow the Lord’s directions. Or you may choose to follow different directions. Maybe your own directions or the directions that your family, friends, and confidantes, et al. advise you to go. Saul too could have chosen to not follow the directions that the Lord gave him through Samuel the Prophet. Rather, Saul could have taken a different route. Instead, Saul could have gone back to his father’s home via the way he came. Saul originally left his father’s home because the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had wandered off and were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you and arise, go look for the donkeys” (1 Samuel 9:3 AMP). So they set off to look for the donkeys. He passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them (1 Samuel 9:4 NASB). And finally, they entered the region of Zuph, and Saul said to his servant, “Let’s go home. By now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys!” (1 Samuel 9:5 NLT). From his father’s home, Saul went through the hill country of Ephraim, then through the land of Shalishah, then through the land of Shaalim, then through the land of the Benjamites, and finally to the region of Zuph. That is the route that he took. Saul could have gone back the way that he came. He could have went from the region of Zuph, then through the land of the Benjamites, then through the land of Shaalim, then through the land of Shalishah, and then through the hill country of Ephraim to reach his father’s home. But he did not. Instead, Saul chose to follow the directions/route that the Lord told him to go through Samuel the Prophet. Now, Saul met with Samuel the Prophet whilst in the region of Zuph. For, after Saul suggested to his servant that they go back home, the servant said to him, “Look here, in this city there is a man of God, and the man is held in honor; everything that he says comes true. Now let us go there; perhaps he can advise us about our journey [and tell us where we should go]” (1 Samuel 9:6 AMP). Now, in this case, the servant made a suggestion to Saul; and he followed the advice of his servant. They went and met the man of God—Samuel. For, as mentioned in the previous post, you do not have to stop listening or seeking or following the advice of others such as your family, friends, and confidantes (or in this case, a servant). But you may have to choose whose advice you shall follow if the Lord’s advice is different from other people’s advice. When they met the man of God, Samuel gave them detailed directions of the path to take. And Saul chose to follow Samuel’s directions. This is because Saul trusted the advice that Samuel the prophet gave to him. Saul did not personally know Samuel the Prophet. And as it was mentioned in the previous post, you might not give your trust to others if you do not know them. Yet, Saul trusted Samuel the Prophet’s advice. Why is that? I reckon it is because of Samuel the Prophet’s reputation. Samuel the Prophet is highly respected by all since everything he says comes to pass. You may not know someone personally, but you may hear good things about that person through others (such as those whom you do trust). And those people may vouch for the someone whom you do not know. And because of this, you may choose to trust that person even though you do not personally know them. That is what Saul did. Even though Saul did not personally know Samuel the Prophet, he chose to trust and follow the guidance that Samuel the Prophet gave to him because his servant had told him that Samuel the Prophet is trustworthy and reputable. As Saul turned and started to leave, God gave him a new heart, and all Samuel’s signs were fulfilled that day. When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw a group of prophets coming toward them. Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he, too, began to prophesy (1 Samuel 10:9-10 NLT). All the signs that Samuel detailed were fulfilled that day. But that does not happen if Saul chooses to not follow the directions that the Lord gave to him through Samuel the Prophet. If Saul chose to take a different route home, then he would not have crossed paths with the two men that were by Rachel’s tomb at Zeltzah; and the two men would not have had an opportunity to tell Saul that the donkey’s that they were looking for have been found. If Saul chose to take a different route home, then he would not have encountered the three men by the big oak tree in Tabor; and those three men would not have had an opportunity to greet him or give him two loaves of bread. And if Saul chose to take a different route home, then he would not have come across a group of prophets and worshippers; and the Spirit of God would not have come upon him, resulting in him prophesying with them. So, you should follow the guidance that the Lord gives you (whether it be directly as you pray to the Lord and commune with Him or indirectly through prophets and other people) lest you miss the connections that the Lord has prepared for you. The Spirit of the Lord came upon Saul; and he started prophesying. That is a preview of the time that is to come when the Lord pours out His Spirit on all humanity like He did with Saul. And like Saul, your sons and your daughters will start to prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. When all who knew him formerly saw that he prophesied with prophets, the people said to one another, “What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” (1 Samuel 10:11 LEB). People who knew Saul saw him prophesying with prophets. They were surprised by this. They did not expect to see Saul prophesying with prophets. They did not realize that the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and changed him into a different person. Thus, the people who knew him wondered what happened to cause him to start prophesying with prophets. Like the people who used to know Saul, the people who knew you will also wonder what happened to you when the Spirit of the Lord comes upon you and they see you prophesying. The people who knew you will be surprised to see you prophesying because they do not expect it. They may have been surprised at the unexpected sight of you prophesying because they know your past. Your past actions. Your past misdeeds. Your flaws and imperfections. The skeletons in your closet that they think preclude you from being loved and accepted by God. But what they may not know is that God’s love never fails; it neither fades nor ends. As such, irregardless of your past, the Lord is willing to pour out His Spirit upon you. And just like Saul, you shall be changed into a different person. Just believe. God bless.","summary":"You should follow the guidance that the Lord gives you (whether it be directly through prayer or indirectly through prophets) lest you miss the connections that the Lord has prepared for you.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/79184573-85daa080-7de2-11ea-9c28-add63ae2e411.jpg","date_published": "2020-04-15T00:00:00+00:00",

        "title":"Circle Of Trust",
        "content_text":"In the previous message, it was suggested that you should let the Lord be your Shepherd. For, when you do that, you shall not lack anything in any sphere of your life since the Lord shall give you more than enough for your needs in all aspects of your life. But it can be hard to let someone be your guide in life if you do not trust that person. Likewise, if you do not trust a person—whether it be the Lord or someone else—it can be hard to listen to their advice let alone follow their guidance. For, if you don’t trust a person, you may not believe that they have your best interests at heart nor may you think that they know which direction to go would be best for your life. There can be a multitude of reasons why you do not trust a person. Maybe you used to trust a person but then lost trust in that person. This can happen to children as they grow up. I reckon that a baby is not born with distrust in their parents. Babies trust and rely on their parents to love them, take care of them, feed them, wipe them, comfort them, keep them safe, and the like. In other words, babies trust and rely on their parents to be their shepherd. Babies trust and rely on their parents to provide them with more than enough for all their needs so that they don’t lack in any aspect of their life. But as the baby grows up into a toddler and beyond, sometimes things happen that may cause that person to stop trusting in their parents. The same thing could happen to those who (used to) believe in or trust in the Lord. Maybe something happened such that you no longer believe in or trust in the Lord to be your Shepherd and provider in all aspects of your life. On the other hand, it is also possible that you never trusted a person. It could be because you do not know the person; they are a stranger to you. As such, you do not know them to give them your trust. For the same reason you may not trust in the Lord: you do not know Him. Instead, He is a stranger to you. And because you do not know Him, you do not trust Him. In either scenario, how can you build trust in the Lord? How can you get to a place where you trust in the Lord? I reckon that it is not too different with how you build trust with any other person. First, you must want to get to a place of trust with a person. If you do not want to trust a person, then you will not get to a place of trust with that person. So you must want to trust a person first. The same goes with the Lord. You must want to get to a place of trust with Him first. For those of you who do not trust people that you do not know, you of course have to get to know the stranger and build a relationship with them to build trust in them. And likewise for them to build trust in you. For, as is mentioned in previous posts, when you befriend and get to know those whom the rest of the world thinks should be shunned, you may rise to be in a position of trust and influence with them such that you may persuade them to turn from their former ways and instead follow Jesus and become His disciple. But this does not happen if you do not take the time to befriend and get to know those whom the world thinks should be shunned. It is the same with the Lord. For you to get to a place of trust with the Lord, you need to build a relationship with Him and get to know Him. Eventually, you may get to the point in the relationship where the Lord trusts you (and vice versa) such that you become a person of influence in His life and are able to persuade Him (and vice versa). Of course, as you have the freedom to choose to build a relationship and get to know a person, you also have the freedom to choose to build a relationship and get to know the Lord. The Lord is not going to force you into a relationship with Him; it is your choice. Of course, the Lord desires to build a relationship with you and build trust in you. So if you decide to build a relationship and trust with the Lord, He is ready and willing to reciprocate. On the other hand, if you do not want to build a relationship and trust with the Lord, then He will be like a spurned lover. As you build relationships with other people, the Lord will be waiting by the phone, metaphorically speaking, hoping that you will change your mind and reach out to Him. For those of you who used to trust a person but now no longer do, then you have to want to rebuild your relationship and trust with that person. And if you do decide to try and rebuild your relationship and trust with a person who had but lost your trust, a good starting point for that may be to find it in your heart to forgive them for their transgressions that caused you to stop trusting in that person. As mentioned in a previous post, you do not have to wait for the person to apologize or show remorse or show that they have changed before forgiving them. Instead, you may decide to forgive a person regardless of whether or not they apologized, sought forgiveness, shown remorse, or shown you that they have changed. The Lord does not trangress; only us humans do. And yet, people can still lose trust in the Lord. This could be because they blame the Lord for things that happened in their life. Or, as it was mentioned in a previous post, it could be because God’s emissaries turn them away from the Lord. It could also be because people listen to competing voices. The voices of their family, friends, and colleagues. And voices in their community, news media, and pop culture. Voices that contradict the voice or word of God. Voices that persuade them to no longer trust the voice or word of God. Voices that say to them: God is irrelevant or unnecessary or dangerous in this day and age. As mentioned in a previous post, those who believe in Jesus ought to be willing to befriend other people, such as those whom the rest of the world view as wicked, so that we may be in a position to persuade them. For, if we are not in a position to influence people, then others will be in a position to influence them. And such people may influence them to stop trusting in the Lord and turn away from God. That could happen to babies as they grow up. Competing voices may tell them not to listen to their parent’s advice or guidance. Competing voices may persuade them to think that they know better than their parents about which direction to go is best for their life. The same thing could happen to those who believe in Jesus. People may tell them to not listen to the Lord’s guidance or advice. And people may persuade them that they know better than the Lord about which direction to go is best for their life. And because of these competing voices, people stop following and relying on the Lord. People stop letting the Lord be their Shepherd. Instead, people rely on and follow the guidance and advice of the competing voices in their life. But I tell you the truth: the Lord knows better than you and your circle of family, friends, confidantes, et al. about the direction that you should go in your life. And that is because the guidance and advice that other people give to you is limited by their knowledge. But, the Lord is all-knowing; He does not have any blind spots or gaps in His knowledge, so the Lord can give you better guidance and advice than your coterie of family, friends, confidantes, et al. It can be similar to when you are trying to get from your current location to another location. You may decide on particular directions/routes to get to a particular place, but such choices are based on the limited knowledge that you and your cohort of family, friends, confidantes, et al. have. And by doing this, you may see that you need to adjust the directions you followed and make detours along the way as you come across unexpected roadblocks and obstacles and dead ends that slow you down or block your path to your destination. The Lord, on the other hand, is all-seeing. Thus, the Lord knows the best path to take to get you from your current location to your destination (destiny). The Lord sees if taking a particular path will lead to a dead end. And the Lord can see if a particular route has obstacles that would block you from proceeding toward your destination. Obstacles that would cause you to deviate from your destination (destiny). Thus, the Lord knows the paths that you should take and the paths that you should avoid to reach your destiny. This is not to say that you should never listen or follow the advice of your clique of family, friends, and confidantes, et al. Of course, their advice may align with the guidance that you receive from the Lord. But, as mentioned in previous messages, when there is a deviation between the Lord’s advice and the advice of your clan of family, friends, and confidantes, et al., you have a choice to make: whose advice shall you follow? Of course it can be difficult to start trusting and following the guidance and advice of the Lord when you have always relied upon and trusted the guidance and advice of your crew of family, friends, and confidantes, et al. That is why getting to know the Lord is an important step toward getting to a place of trust with Him. And as you get to know the Lord, also ask for His guidance and advice with respect to your life and the direction that you should go. You do not have to stop asking your family, friends, and confidantes, et al. for their guidance and advice. You can continue to do that. But in addition to asking your family, friends, and confidantes, et al., you can start to ask the Lord for His guidance and advice. You can start with small things. You can take baby steps with your relationship with the Lord. And as He builds your trust in Him, you can start to trust in Him with the bigger and more important things in your life. And maybe He eventually becomes a part of your crew. He may become like family to you (think: God the Father in Heaven; Jesus Christ, your Brother). And He may become like a friend and confidante to you (think: Jesus Christ, Holy Spirit). But this does not happen if you do not want to build a relationship with the Lord and get to know Him and get to a place of trust with Him, so decide today whether or not you want the Lord to become a part of your circle of trust. God bless.","summary":"It can be hard to let the Lord be your Shepherd if you do not trust Him. So how can you build trust in Him?

        "content_text":"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. Psalm 23:1 NKJV The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. Psalm 23:1 NIV Because the Lord is my Shepherd, I have everything I need! Psalm 23:1 TLB The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. In other words, when the Lord is your shepherd, you shall not lack anything; instead, you shall have everything that you need. (Note that it says that you shall have everything that you need, and not everything that you want.) Now, the things that you shall not lack is not limited to worldly things such as money; jobs or businesses; private homes, cars, and jets; and the like. No! This lack is referring to every area of your life. For, there are a multitude of people who do not lack such worldly things, yet feel empty inside because they lack in other areas of their lives such as: mental and physical health; love, joy, peace, and other emotional needs; purpose and fulfillment; and the like. But when the Lord is your shepherd, you shall not lack in any aspect of your life. Now, this is not to say that you will be shielded from challenges and difficulties when the Lord is your shepherd. For, as King David (the author) says: Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me (Psalm 23:4 NASB). In his journey in life, King David walked through the valley of the shadow of death. Or, in other words, King David experienced challenges and difficulties in his journey in life. But, as mentioned in previous message, the Lord is always with you. And the Lord is there for you in the midst of the challenges or difficulties that you are facing. The Lord is there to meet your needs whilst amidst your challenges or difficulties. The Lord gives you peace so that you do not fear. The Lord gives you comfort so that you are not overcome with anxiety and stress whilst amidst your challenges or difficulties. The Lord gives you strength so that you are not overpowered by your challenges and difficulties. And the Lord gives you wisdom and guidance so that you may get through your challenges and difficulties. Likewise, King David said: You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings (Psalm 23:5 NLT). Now, as a follower of the Lord your Shepherd, the people of this world may hate on you or condemn you because they disagree with you and your beliefs. Such people may cause challenges or difficulties in your life. But when the Lord is your Shepherd, He shall prepare a feast for you in the presence of your enemies. In other words, your enemies shall see that the Lord is with you. Likewise, your enemies will see that the Lord has honored your faith in Him. And your enemies will see that the Lord has abundantly blessed you such that you do not lack in any aspect of your life. If the Lord is not your Shepherd, then someone or something else is your shepherd. If the Lord is not the One who leads and guides you in your journey in life, then it is someone or something else who leads and guides you in your journey in life. This may be illustrated in a particular story in King David’s life—the story of King David and a woman named Bathsheba, which you may read in chapters eleven and twelve in The Second Book of Samuel. But for the purposes of this post, here is a brief summary of that story: One day, King David saw a woman bathing from the roof of his home. Intrigued, David inquired about her; and he found out that she (Bathsheba) is the daughter of a man named Eliam and the wife of a man named Uriah. Undeterred, she sent messengers to bring her to him so that he may lay with her. This unbalanced power dynamic between the man (David) and the woman (Bathsheba) may be familiar to those who have had similar experiences or read similar stories in this day and age. Experiences and stories that birthed the #MeToo movement. However, as mentioned in previous posts, while the Lord will always love you, He may not agree with your action. The Lord also did not agree with David’s actions, as you will see later. King David’s action resulted in Bathsheba becoming pregnant. When he found out that she was with child, he came up with a plan to hide his indiscretion. When that plan failed, David came up with another plan to get her husband intentionally killed in the battlefield. This plan succeeded. Now, in this particular instance, was the Lord David’s Shepherd? Was King David following the lead and guidance of the Lord when he chose to lay with Bathsheba, and subsequently chose to have her husband killed in the battlefield? No, he was not. The Lord was not his Shepherd in this instance. So who was King David’s shepherd in this instance? His own desire. For, each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death (James 1:14-15 NKJV). In other words, temptation is the pull of man’s own evil thoughts and wishes. These evil thoughts lead to evil actions and afterwards to the death penalty from God (James 1:14-15 TLB). David was enticed by the woman that he saw from the roof of his home; David desired her. David acted upon his desire; it birthed sin and brought forth death. In this instance, David was lead by his own desires instead of the Lord. But if the Lord was his Shepherd in this instance, then he would not have been lead to sin. For the Lord does not lead you to sin; rather, He leads you in the paths of righteousness For His name’s sake (Psalm 23:3 NKJV). In this way, David is not too different from Adam and Eve. As mentioned in a previous post, Adam and Eve worked in the garden of Eden; they were allowed to eat of the fruit of every tree in the garden of Eden except for the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. One day, they were enticed to eat fruit from that tree. The woman saw that the tree had fruit that was good to eat, nice to look at, and desirable for making someone wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it (Genesis 3:6 GW). The woman desired the fruit of the tree. Therefore, like King David, the woman acted upon that desire; and it birthed sin, which brought forth death. The Lord was not Adam and Eve’s shepherd in this instance; instead, they were lead and guided by their own desires. I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. 2 Samuel 12:8 NIV As mentioned in that previous post, Adam and Eve ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because they were unsatisfied with what the Lord had already given them, namely the fruit of every other tree in the garden of Eden. And because of this dissatisfaction, they desired more. Likewise, King David was unsatisfied with all that the Lord had already given him. And because of his dissatisfaction, David desired more. This desire for more was not because the Lord did not give David enough such that he was lacking in some area of his life. The Lord gave David more than enough. The Lord gave David his master’s house and wives. The Lord also gave David all of Israel and Judah. And if what the Lord had given him was too little, then the Lord would have given him even more so that he has enough for all his needs. Thus, King David’s desire for more was born from his dissatisfaction with what the Lord had already given him, and not because the Lord did not give him enough. Like Adam and Eve and David, people of this world may be dissatisfied with what they have. Because of this dissatisfaction, they desire more even though they have more than enough for their needs; so the people of this world act upon this desire for more. You may have noticed this, as there has been an increased frequency of such stories over the last couple of years. Stories of men (the married and unmarried variety) in a plethora of industries (such as the media, entertainment, sports, government, finance, tech, religious, non-profit, and the like) acting upon their desire to be with women who are not their wives. Women such as journalists, actresses, gymnasts, porn stars, analysts and managers, engineers, church members, activists and volunteers, and the like. Women who had not consented to such actions by those men. Women who were taken advantage of by men in positions of power and influence. Women who felt like they had no choice but to begrudgingly accept such behaviour from men lest they be fired or denied future opportunities in the business or industry. In these cases, the men may be like David and the woman like Bathsheba, who may have felt like she had no choice but to partake in what David wanted to do with her because of the unbalanced power dynamic between them and the consequence or retaliation that could arise if she did not partake in what he wanted to do with her. As mentioned earlier, even though the Lord shall always love you, the Lord does not always endorse or agree with your actions because those actions birth sin and bring forth death (or consequences). Those consequences may include: death of your job or business; death of your reputation; death of your marriage; death of harmony with your friends, family, church community, colleagues, and social groups; and the like. The Lord did not agree with David’s action. In fact, the Lord was displeased with what David had done (2 Samuel 11:27 NLT) since the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord (2 Samuel 11:27 NASB). Likewise, the thing that David had done birthed sin and brought forth death (or consequences). Those consequences included: death of the child that he conceived with the woman, Bathsheba; death of relationship with his other wives; and death of harmony in his household. So: Whom shall you choose to be your shepherd? Shall you choose the Lord as your Shepherd? Or shall you choose to be lead by your own desires? I suggest for you to let the Lord be your Shepherd rather than be lead by your own desires. If you have been letting your own desires lead and guide your actions in life, it is not too late to change course. It is not too late to start letting the Lord lead and guide your actions in life. It is not too late to start letting the Lord be your Shepherd in life. For, even though the Lord did not endorse or agree with David’s actions, the Lord forgave David. Likewise, even though the Lord did not endorse or agree with the actions of the men who were exposed in the #MeToo era, the Lord is willing to forgive those people. Whilst the people of this world may not be willing to forgive those caught in the #MeToo era, the Lord is willing to forgive them. The Lord is also willing to give those people a second chance in life. And the Lord is willing to conceive new life to that which died because of their actions. If their job or business died because of their action, then the Lord is willing to conceive a new job for them. Likewise, if their friendships died because of their action, the Lord is willing to conceive new friends for them. And If their church died because of their action, then the Lord is willing to conceive a new church for them. Thus, if you currently find that some aspects of your life are dead because you chose to follow the lead of your own desire, then you too may have a new life by choosing to instead follow the lead/guidance of the Lord. A life wherein all of your needs are met such that you shall not lack anything in any aspect of your life. Just believe. And let the Lord be your Shepherd. God bless.","summary":"If the Lord is not your Shepherd, then something else is your shepherd.

        "content_text":"Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: “Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.” Esther 4:16 NIV Esther asked one of her attendants to tell her cousin—Mordecai—to go gather together all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for her by not eating or drinking for three days. Esther commanded them to fast because it was brought to her attention that the king allowed a decree be written in his name to destroy all the Jews in the provinces of his kingdom because he was persuaded that it was not fitting for the king to let the Jews remain living in his kingdom. And after three days of fasting for her, Esther planned to go to the king even though it is against the law. For, at that time, “All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives” (Esther 4:11 NIV). As the queen, she could have lived for herself whilst not caring about the plight of her people—the Jews. And even though she too was a Jew, as the queen, she could have thought that she would be safe from the destruction destined for the rest of the Jews. As such, she could have not cared about trying to save the Jews who were unsafe from the scheduled day of annihilation. She could have just continued to live her life as the queen, secure in her belief that she is safe from annihilation while not caring about the safety or destiny of others. Those who believe in Jesus may not be too different. As believers in Jesus, we believe that we are safe/saved from a destiny of eternal punishment because we received the gift of eternal life with Jesus in heaven. As believers in Jesus, we may have a tendency to live our lives, secure in our knowledge that we are safe from the scheduled day of reckoning while not caring about the destiny of others who do not believe in Jesus and are not saved. As such, we do not care to try and help others to safety by preaching the Good News of Jesus Christ to those who do not know Him. Instead, we who believe in Jesus live our lives whilst not caring about the safety or destiny of others. Esther had commanded all the Jews who are in Susa to fast for her after her cousin—Mordecai—had persuaded her that she became the queen for a reason: to try and save the Jews from their scheduled destruction. In other words, Esther was persuaded to live not just for herself but for a higher purpose than herself. Likewise, you who believes in Jesus have secured a spot in the Kingdom of Heaven for a reason: so that you may try and help others to safety through preaching Jesus to they who do not yet know Him. You were not saved just so that you may live your life knowing that you have a spot in the Kingdom of Heaven. No! You were saved so that you may live for a higher purpose than just yourself. On the third day of the fast, Esther put on her royal robes and entered the inner court of the palace, just across from the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne, facing the entrance. When he saw Queen Esther standing there in the inner court, he welcomed her and held out the gold scepter to her. So Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter. Then the king asked her, “What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!” And Esther replied, “If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for the king.” Esther 5:1-4 NLT On the third day of the fast, Esther put on her royal robes and entered the inner court of the palace, just across from the king’s hall. As mentioned earlier, it was against the law to approach the king in the inner court without being summoned by him; and those who do shall be put to death unless the king extends the golden scepter to them and spares their life. As such, when Esther entered the inner court without being summoned beforehand by the king, she was risking her life because there was no guarantee that the king would extend the golden scepter to her and thus spare her life. But she did it anyways because she was willing to risk her life in order to try and save the Jews from their scheduled annihilation. She was a queen. She was a member of the elite ruling class. She had money, power, and attendants. She was living a life of comfort. And yet she was willing to risk it all in order to at least try and save others from the scheduled annihilation. You should do likewise. Like Queen Esther, you should be willing to risk your life in order to try and save those who do not yet believe in Jesus from their day of reckoning. Like Queen Esther, you may be living a life of comfort. You may have a job. You may have money, power, attendants, and the like. But you should be willing to risk your life of comfort in order to at least try and save others from the eternal destruction that is scheduled for those who do not believe in Jesus. What if she chose not to risk it all? What if, she chose to focus on preserving her life as well as all that it entails rather than risk losing her life and all that it entails? What if she chose to not try and save the others from their annihilation that was scheduled for a certain day? Then maybe she would become a witness to their annihilation on the scheduled day. Would she have felt bad for not at least trying to do something to save them? Would she have felt sad upon witnessing the annihilation of her friends and family? Or would she have thought to herself, “Well, at least I’m still alive.” Would she have found comfort in the life that she preserved for herself knowing that she did nothing to try and preserve the life of others? Or would she come to find that everything that she preserved with her life—job, status, money, power, attendants, and the like—cannot provide comfort to her mind and her heart knowing that she did nothing? Likewise, what if you choose not to risk it all? What if you choose to focus on preserving your life as well as all that it entails rather than losing your life and all that it entails? What if you, as a believer in Jesus, chose to not try and save others from the day of reckoning that is scheduled for a certain day? Would you feel bad for not at least trying to do something to save them even though you know the fate of those who do not believe in Jesus? Would you feel sad knowing the fate of your friends and family who do not yet believe in Jesus? Or do you only care that your life is secure and comfortable whilst not caring about the lives of other people? There was a couple of months between the day that Queen Esther found out about the king’s decree to destroy all the Jews in the provinces of his kingdom and the day that such destruction was to take place. Would she be able to live day in and day out knowing about the impending annihilation that is scheduled to come without doing something to at least try and save them? Would she be able to fall asleep knowing she did everything she could to at least try and save others or would she lay awake at night knowing that she has done nothing? Would she awake to live her life whilst believing that she is safe in the kingdom? Or would she awake knowing there are people outside of this kingdom who are destined for annihilation, therefore think that she must do something to at least try and save them? As a believer in Jesus, you may know that there is only a certain amount of time before the scheduled day of reckoning is to take place. How is it that you are able to live day in and day out knowing about the impending day of reckoning that is scheduled to come without doing something to at least try to save those who do not yet believe in Jesus? How are you able to fall asleep peacefully knowing that you have done nothing? How are you able to wake up and live your life of comfort knowing that you have a spot secured in the Kingdom of Heaven whilst also knowing that there are people who are not yet saved from the day of reckoning because they do not yet believe in Jesus? Is it because you only care about yourself and not about other people? There were many Jews living in the provinces of his kingdom. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that Queen Esther had not personally met or known all of the Jews who were living in the provinces of his kingdom. And yet, Queen Esther was willing to risk her life to try and save people whom she has not met before and did not personally know. Likewise, there are a lot of people in this world who do not yet believe in Jesus whom you have never personally met or known. So you may be wondering how you may, like Queen Esther, do something to save people whom you have never met or known beforehand. This is not a new idea. The advent of radio and television has allowed people to preach Jesus and share the Word of God to listeners and viewers all around the world. And I reckon that it is safe to presume that the radio and televangelist have not met or known every listener and viewer of their programs. More recently, with the advent of the Internet, a person can preach Jesus and share the Word of God through a variety of mediums, such as: websites and blogs; podcasts; live streaming through a social media platform such as Facebook, Youtube, or Twitch; and the like. And I reckon that it is safe to presume that those who preach Jesus and share the Word of God through one or more of these platforms will not have met or known every reader, listener, or viewer. But we preach Jesus and share the Word of God through these different mediums and platforms for the purpose of trying to save those who do not yet know Jesus from the scheduled day of reckoning that is to come. Because, as mentioned in a previous post, for a person to believe in Him, the person must first hear about Him. Therefore, it is our hope that those who happen upon our website or podcast or live stream shall hear the Word of God and decide to believe in Jesus and accept Jesus as their personal Saviour and get to know Him. Through the use of these different mediums and platforms, we have an opportunity to at least try and do something to save people whom we may never meet or know personally similarly to how Queen Esther decided to do something to at least try and save people whom she has not met or known personally. When Queen Esther approached the king on the third day of the fast, he said to her: “What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!” Queen Esther could have asked for half the kingdom and the king would have given it to her. But she did not. Instead, she requested for the king to attend the banquet that she had prepared for him. In other words, Queen Esther could have chosen to live for herself and for her benefit only. But she did not. Instead, she decided to live for a higher purpose than herself. She chose to use her position to try and help those who were destined for annihilation. And because she chose to live for a higher purpose than herself, she was able to save a multitude of people who were destined for annihilation. In this way, Esther is not too different from Jesus. Esther fasted for three days and nights. Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the wilderness. At the end of the fast, she went to the king who was willing to give her half his kingdom. At the end of Jesus’ fasting, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me” (Matthew 4:8-9 ESV). Like Esther, Jesus could have chosen to live for himself and his own benefit by doing a certain something in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world. But like Esther, Jesus did not. Instead, Jesus chose to live for a higher purpose. Jesus decided to live for the purposes of trying to save the people who are destined for eternal destruction on the day of reckoning. And like Esther, because Jesus chose to live for a higher purpose, he was able to save a multitude who were destined for eternal destruction. And that is because, like Esther, Jesus was willing to die in order to save us. The kingdom that was offered to Esther and Jesus could be considered as a temptation that is made available to them. And if accepted, said temptation will distract them from focusing on their purpose. Likewise, we can be tempted by things of this world that may cause us to become distracted from focusing on our purpose. However, like Esther and Jesus, we ought not succumb to such temptation and distractions. Instead, we ought to keep focused on our purpose in life. One last thing. In another message, shared previously, it was mentioned that people of this world do not think that it is a good idea to associate with or befriend those whom they view as wicked. And the example used in the previous message was that of a former president of a country. The people of this world thought that everyone should shun this person like a leper rather than associate with let alone befriend this person. The message, on the other hand, suggested that we who believe in Jesus should be willing to associate with and befriend such people so that we may be in a position to compel them to turn from their old ways and to instead seek God and His righteousness by following Jesus as well as becoming His disciple. Because I tell you the truth: whilst you may not be willing to associate with those whom you view as wicked, other people shall have no such reservations; and it is they who shall be in a position to influence those who are in power. As it was mentioned at the beginning of this post, the king allowed a decree be written in his name to destroy all the Jews in the provinces of his kingdom because he was persuaded that it was not fitting for the king to let the Jews remain living in his kingdom. Who influenced the king to let such a decree to be written in his name? Someone who had no reservations about associating with the king so that they may be in a position to influence the king. And that is what happened. The person influenced the king to decree something that would result in death. Rather than thinking that it is not a good idea to associate with and befriend those whom you view as wicked, what if you followed the example set by the person who influenced the king? What if, instead of shunning the presidents of countries, culture, companies, and the like, you associate with them so that you may be positioned to influence them? Then maybe you can influence them to decree something that would result in life rather than death. If you don’t position yourself to become a person of influence in a someone’s life, somebody else will. So why not you? You could be the difference between life and death. Of multitudes. Think about that. God bless.","summary":"Believers in Jesus have secured a spot in the Kingdom of Heaven for a reason: so that you may try and help others to safety through preaching Jesus to those who do not yet believe in Him.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/72377124-2b478080-36dd-11ea-9ad3-42c27aaeb44a.jpg","date_published": "2020-01-15T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"The Left—liberals, democrats, and their equivalent around the world—advocate for people who make more than a certain amount of money (ofttimes referred to as The Elite) to pay higher taxes such that the government has more money in their coffers that can be used for services that are of help and of benefit to those who do not make as much money (such as homeless shelters, affordable housings, and public transit) and services that may be of help and of benefit to all irregardless of money (such as sewage, public parks, and garbage collection). In other words, The Left advocates for living not just for yourself and just your own benefit, but also to the benefit of other people in the community, city, province/state, and country that you live in. In essence, The Left advocates for you to live for a higher purpose than just yourself. Rather than living for just yourself and to the benefit of yourself, The Left advocates for living to be a net benefit/blessing to others. The Right—conservatives, republicans, libertarians, and their equivalent around the world—advocate for people to pay less taxes, which, of course, means that the government has less money that can be used for services that are of help and of benefit to those that make less money. In other words, those on The Right is basically saying that what people make from their work is for themselves and for their own benefit. As such, the government should not be allowed to take away (through tax policy) what people make and then use it for other purposes. Instead, The Right advocates for people to have the freedom to choose what to do with the money that they make. If people want to use the money that they make for the benefit of others in the community, city, province/state, and country that they live in, that is their choice to make; not the government. As mentioned in the previous post, The Lord has a plan and purpose for your life. And just like The Left, The Lord has a higher purpose for your life than to just live for the benefit of yourself. Just like The Left, the higher purpose for your life is to be a blessing to the people within the community, city, province/state, and country that you live in. However, unlike The Left, The Lord is not going to force you into living for a higher purpose than yourself. Unlike The Left, The Lord is not going to force you to be magnanimous. Like The Right, The Lord gives you the freedom to make your own choices; and that includes the choice to be or not to be a blessing to people in the community, city, province/state, and country that you live in. Like The Right, you may prefer such freedom of choice because you think that you know best how to be of benefit to others, but I tell you the truth: The Lord knows best with regards to how you may be a blessing to others. Ergo, you should entrust The Lord to use you to the benefit of others in a similar manner to how The Left entrusts the government to know best how to use the taxes that you paid to benefit others. And you do this by trusting and following and fulfilling The Lord’s plans and purpose for your life rather than thinking (because of ego or arrogance, maybe) that you know better than The Lord and following your own plans for your life. The Left—liberals, democrats, and their equivalent around the world—are pro choice with respect to abortions. With respect to abortion, The Left advocates for having the freedom to choose what to do with the child made within them in a similar manner to how The Right advocates for the freedom to choose what to do with the money that they made. And with respect to abortions, The Left does not advocate for the passing of policies that force them to be magnanimous and do things for the benefit of others—the child made within them—in a similar manner to how The Right does not advocate for the passing of tax policies that force them to be magnanimous and do things for the benefit of other people in their community they live in. Instead, The Left advocates for having the freedom to choose whether or not to do something for the benefit of others (the child within them) in a similar manner to how The Right advocates for the freedom to choose whether or not to use the money they make for the benefit of others (in their community, city, province/state, and country that they live in). Like The Right with respect to the money they make, The Left may advocate for having the freedom to choose whether or not to keep the child within them because they think that they know what’s best with regards to them and the child being made within them, but I tell you the truth: The Lord knows best in that regard. The Right—conservatives, republicans, libertarians, and their equivalent around the world—are pro life (of the child being made within a person) with respect to abortions. The Right advocates for the passing of policies that force a person to be magnanimous and to live for a higher purpose than just themselves by doing something to the benefit of the child that is being made within them (letting the child live) in a similar manner to how The Left advocates for policies that increase taxes on The Elite to force them to be magnanimous and to live for a higher purpose than just themselves by paying more taxes that can be used for the benefit of others in their community, city, province/state, and country that they live in. And with respect to abortion, The Right advocates for the taking away of a person’s freedom to choose what to do with the child being made within them whilst advocating for a person to have the freedom to choose what to do with the money they make. The Lord, basically, is both pro choice and pro life. The Lord is pro choice in the sense that we have the freedom to choose what to do. And pro life because The Lord has a plan and purpose for each person, ergo He would suggest that you choose to give the child within you the opportunity to live and fulfill the plan and purpose that The Lord has for them. Therefore, The Lord would suggest that you choose to live for a higher purpose than yourself and do something for the benefit of others—the child within you and the people who shall be blessed by that child, for as mentioned earlier, The Lord plans and purposes for people to be a net benefit/blessing to others within their community, city, province/state, and country that they live in. Therefore, choose to bring forth the child within you in a similar manner to how Mary chose to bring forth The Child within her. Mary could have said no to bringing forth The Child within her; instead, she chose to live for a higher purpose than just herself. I reckon that it is safe to say that The Child that she brought forth became a blessing to a multitude of people. That is because The Child chose to trust and follow and fulfill the plan and purpose that His God the Father in Heaven had for Him. God’s plan for The Child were conceived before The Child was within Mary. Likewise, The Lord knew of the child within you before you knew of the child. Ergo, The Lord has a plan and purpose for the child within you even though you may not have planned to be with child. Therefore, choose to give the child within you the opportunity to live and fulfill the plan and purpose that The Lord has for them. Merry Christmas and God bless.","summary":"The Lord has a higher purpose for your life than to live for the benefit of yourself.

        "content_text":"Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” Genesis 27:41 NIV Esau held a grudge against his younger brother, Jacob, because of the blessing that their father, Isaac, gave to Jacob. Esau begrudged Jacob so much such that Esau harbored thoughts of killing him. Now, as mentioned in a previous message, whilst it is okay to be angry at sin (such as immorality, injustice, and ungodly behavior), do not let that anger lead you to sin by begrudging them and resenting them because of their actions. For, when you nurture and cultivate the seed of anger that has been planted within you, it may bear fruit and cause you to sin. Apparently, Esau did not get that memo. Instead of letting go of his anger at Jacob’s actions, Esau nurtured his anger; and this anger bloomed thoughts of killing his younger brother. When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides. Genesis 27:42-44 NIV Esau’s plan to kill Jacob made its way to their mother, Rebekah. Not wanting to see his plans come to pass, Rebekah told Jacob to flee at once and take refuge in the home of her brother, Laban, in Harran. And I reckon that, if Jacob did not flee to his uncle’s home, then he would have suffered the same fate as Abel. As it was mentioned in a previous post, one day, whilst they were in the field, Cain killed Abel because of the seed of anger that he harboured and nurtured and cultivated within him. I reckon that, if Jacob did not flee to his uncle’s home, then Esau, a skillful hunter and man of the field, would have lured his brother Jacob, a mild-mannered person with a quiet temperament who preferred to stay at home, out to the field to kill him in a similar manner to how Cain lured Abel out to the field and killed him. Esau held a grudge against his younger brother, Jacob, because of the blessing that their father, Isaac, gave to Jacob. This is because the blessing that their father, Isaac, gave to Jacob was originally meant for Esau. However, Jacob, at the behest of his mother Rebekah, schemed to deceive his father, Isaac, into giving Esau’s blessing to him. Jacob was able to take the blessing that was originally meant for his older brother, Esau, because their father, Isaac, was old and blind. And one day, Isaac told Esau to hunt some wild game and prepare some savory food for him to eat; and afterwards, Isaac was going to bless Esau. Rebekah heard Isaac say this to Esau. So she told Jacob to get two goats from the flock so that she may make savory food for him to bring to his father; and then receive the blessing that was meant for Esau. And to pull off her scheme, Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins (Genesis 27:15-16 NIV) so that Jacob, who is smooth-skinned, would feel like Esau, who is hairy, to Isaac if he touched him. When the food was prepared, Jacob brought it to Isaac. Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.” So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (Genesis 27:21-22 ESV). As mentioned in a previous message, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God by praying to and communing with Him (as well as reading of the Scriptures), you shall become familiar with the Lord God’s voice, such that, even though you do not see Him, you shall know that it is Him that is speaking to you. Well, Isaac had a relationship with his son Jacob. As such, even though Isaac’s eyes were too dim to see Jacob, he was still able to recognize that the voice that he heard was Jacob’s voice. Nevertheless, irregardless of Isaac’s skepticism that the person before him was actually Esau, Isaac chose to give the person before him the blessing meant for Esau. Now, as an outside observer, you may have no sympathy for Jacob; and because of what he did, you may not care about Jacob. Instead, you may think that Jacob deserves to pay consequences for his actions—deceiving Isaac, his father, and stealing the blessing meant for Esau, his brother. Well, the Lord is not like you. As mentioned in a previous post, the Lord cares about the wicked. Likewise, the Lord knows that you are imperfect—that you are going to make mistakes and do things that He does not endorse. Whilst the world may see your actions as reason to shun you from society, the Lord sees you as someone in need to be enveloped with His love. For, as mentioned in a previous post, we who are imperfect are perfect emissaries of God’s love and forgiveness and acceptance and grace of all. In fact, those who have made more mistakes have had more opportunities to experience God’s love and forgiveness than those who have made less mistakes in their lives. (Now, just to be clear, this is not a suggestion for you to purposely make mistakes so that you experience God’s love and forgiveness.) As mentioned previously, the people of this world think that those who do wrongs do not deserve their sympathy or love. Instead, people of this world, in this day and age, think that those who do wrong should be shunned from the presence of and isolated from the rest of society like a restless wanderer (or vagabond). The people of this world think that those who do wrong do not deserve to have a future and purpose in life; instead, they should live the rest of their lives without purpose like restless wanderers or vagabonds. But the Lord is not like you. Not only does the Lord think that those who do wrong deserve His love and sympathy, the Lord also has a future and purpose for those who do wrong. Doing wrong does not disqualify you from having a future and purpose in life in the eyes of the Lord. As mentioned above, Rebekah told Jacob to flee at once and take refuge in the home of her brother, Laban, in Harran, until Esau’s fury subsides. On his way to Harran, Jacob stopped at a certain place to rest for the night; and he had a dream of a ladder that went from the earth to the heavens. And there above it stood the Lord, and he said: “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you” (Genesis 28:13-15 NIV). Irregardless of what Jacob did in the past, the Lord had a plan, a purpose, and a future for him. Ergo, to those who have done wrong and made mistakes: those wrongs do not preclude you from having a future and purpose in life. Irregardless of the wrongs that you have done and mistakes that you have made, the Lord still has a plan and purpose and future for your life. The people of this world may think that you do not deserve to have a future. But the Lord is not like them. Just believe that the Lord is with you and will not leave you until His plans and future and purpose for your life are fulfilled in a similar manner to how the Lord told Jacob that He would be with him and not leave him until He has done what He promised him. God bless.","summary":"Doing wrong does not disqualify you from having a future and purpose in life in the eyes of the Lord.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/71051414-404ce600-2116-11ea-9731-3dc98f015642.jpg","date_published": "2019-12-18T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"The Lord gave this message to Jonah son of Amittai: “Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are.” But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction to get away from the Lord. He went down to the port of Joppa, where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish. He bought a ticket and went on board, hoping to escape from the Lord by sailing to Tarshish. Jonah 1:1-3 NLT There was a great city called Nineveh; its people were wicked. The people of Nineveh did things that the Lord did not agree with. And as mentioned in a previous post, when such a thing happens, there may be real-world consequences. As such, the Lord asked Jonah to go to Nineveh to forewarn those people of the real-world consequences that they would face for their actions. For, as it was mentioned in a message posted previously, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord, He may forewarn you when certain actions of yours shall lead to the death of you or some aspect of your life. Well, the Lord may likewise forewarn those who do not know Him. This is because the Lord cares about all, including the wicked. Therefore, the Lord asked Jonah to forewarn the people of Nineveh about His impending judgment against them. But Jonah did not want to go to Nineveh to forewarn the people there about God’s impending judgment against them since he did not care about the people of Nineveh. In fact, Jonah did not want the people of Nineveh to be spared and saved; instead, Jonah wanted to see the people of Nineveh be punished and perish. And so, Jonah got up and fled from the presence of the Lord. Instead of going to Nineveh, Jonah went in the opposite direction. Jonah went down to the port of Joppa where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish; and he bought a ticket and boarded the ship to escape from having to go to Nineveh to forewarn the people there. Now, the people of this world may not be too different from Jonah. Similarly to Jonah, you may know of people whom you view as wicked—like (former) presidents and politicians, celebrities and athletes, execs and other leaders. And similarly to Jonah, you may not care about those people whom you view as wicked. And like Jonah, you may not want those people to be saved; instead, you want to see them punished for their wickedness and perish (canceled) from society. You may have no sympathy for the people whom you view as wicked, but the Lord certainly does. The Lord cares about the wicked. And so, the Lord really wanted Jonah to go to Nineveh to forewarn the people of His impending judgment against them. Thus, the Lord sent a violent wind over the sea. The storm was so powerful that the ship [that Jonah was on] was in danger of breaking up (Jonah 1:4 GW). The Lord would not let Jonah flee to Tarshish. Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them (Jonah 1:13 ESV). The sailors tried to steer their ship back to safety, but they failed. So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging (Jonah 1:15 NKJV). Now the Lord arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights (Jonah 1:17 NLT). Then the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land (Jonah 2:10 HCSB). And then Jonah went to Nineveh and forewarned the people there of God’s judgment against them; and the people of Nineveh turned from their evil ways. When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened (Jonah 3:10 NLT). Now, this does not happen if Jonah chooses to shun the people of Nineveh rather than take the time and effort to go and engage with them and talk to them. Likewise, the people of this world may not see those they deem to be evil turn from their ways if they choose to shun and ignore them rather than take the time and effort to go and engage with them and talk with them. Ergo, you ought to be willing to associate with those whom you deem to be wicked and engage with them and talk to them. This is, of course, assuming you actually want to see them turn from their wicked ways. But maybe the people of this world are like Jonah in that they do not really care about those whom they deem wicked. Instead, like Jonah, maybe the people of this world just want to see those whom they deem to be wicked be punished and perish (canceled) from society. When the Lord decided to relent from meting out the judgment that He had sentenced the people of Nineveh to, it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry. So he prayed to the Lord, and said, “Ah, Lord, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm (Jonah 4:1-2 NKJV). In a way, Jonah is not too different from Cain from a previous message, who became angry at the Lord because of perceived injustices. Jonah was angry that the people of Nineveh would not be punished for their wickedness. And Jonah was angry that the Lord showed mercy and lovingkindness to the people of Nineveh. For, Jonah did not think that people of Nineveh deserved mercy and compassion because the people of Nineveh did not show mercy and lovingkindness to those affected by their wicked ways. Like Jonah, maybe the people of this world just want to see justice to be served to those they deem to be wicked. Therefore, maybe the people of this world are angry because it seems like those that they deem to be wicked are not being held accountable for their actions. And maybe the people of this world are angry that those they deem to be wicked are seemingly getting away without paying any consequences for their actions. Similarly to Jonah, maybe people of this world think that those they deem to be wicked do not deserve mercy and compassion because people of this world think that those they deem to be wicked did not show mercy and compassion to those affected by their wicked ways. Maybe the people of this world would prefer that those whom they deem wicked are punished and perish (canceled) from society for their wicked actions similarly to how the people of Sodom and Gomorrah were punished and perished because of their wicked ways. The Lord said, “Abraham, I have heard that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are doing all kinds of evil things. Now I am going down to see for myself if those people really are that bad. If they aren’t, I want to know about it.” Genesis 18:20-21 CEV There was a city called Sodom; and another city called Gomorrah. The people of those two cities did all kinds of evil things that the Lord did not agree with. As such, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are not too different from the people of the great city of Nineveh. The Lord told Abraham about His plans. The Lord told Abraham that He was going down to see for Himself if the people of Sodom and Gomorrah were really as bad as He had heard. If so, then the people of Sodom and Gomorrah would face real-world consequences for their actions. In this sense, Abraham is not too different from Jonah. For, like Abraham, the Lord told Jonah about the real-world consequences that the people of Nineveh would face for the wicked actions that He had seen them do. And this is because both Abraham and Jonah had cultivated a relationship with the Lord. And as mentioned previously, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord, He may tell you about things that are to come. When the Lord told Abraham about His plans for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, he could have responded in a similar manner to how Jonah responded when the Lord told him about His judgment against the people of Nineveh. Like Jonah, Abraham could have shown no sympathy or compassion to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. And like Jonah, Abraham could have desired for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah to be punished and perish for their wicked ways. Like Jonah, Abraham could have thought that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah deserved their fate because they must be held accountable for their actions. But that is not how Abraham chose to respond when informed of His plans for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Instead, Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? (Genesis 18:23-24 NIV) When informed about the Lord’s plans for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham chose to approach the Lord rather than running away from the Lord like Jonah. Also, Abraham tried to save the people of Sodom and Gomorrah from punishment and perishment for their wicked deeds by reasoning with the Lord to show them mercy and compassion. In fact, Abraham was able to reason with the Lord until He agreed to spare the city if He found ten righteous people within it (as opposed to the fifty righteous people that Abraham initially started at). It was just unfortunate that there were not ten righteous people in the city of Sodom and Gomorrah. I reckon that if Abraham negotiated the Lord down to spare the city if there was one righteous person in it, then the Lord would have agreed to that. And the Lord surely would have spared the people of Sodom and Gomorrah since there was one righteous person living within that city: Lot. Lot lived in Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot lived amidst those who did evil in the eyes of the Lord. Though the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did evil in the eyes of the Lord, Lot did not shun or ignore them as if they had leprosy. In this sense, Lot is similar to Jesus from the previous message who was willing to associate with and engage with and befriend tax collectors and sinners. For, as it is mentioned in a previous post, you cannot turn people from their wicked ways by shunning them. Instead, you ought to be willing to associate with those whom you deem to be wicked and engage with them and talk to them. And that is what Lot did. For, when the people of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to do a certain thing, Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing” (Genesis 19:6-7 NIV). Of course, when you appeal to people to turn from their evil ways, it is possible that they ignore your appeals. In fact, that is what the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did when Lot had appealed to them to turn from their wicked ways. They said, “Get lost! You drop in from nowhere and now you’re going to tell us how to run our lives. We’ll treat you worse than them!” And they charged past Lot to break down the door (Genesis 19:9 MSG). And because the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did not heed Lot’s appeals to turn from their wicked ways, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah faced real-world consequences for their wicked deeds. For, the Lord made burning sulfur and fire rain out of heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah. He destroyed those cities, the whole plain, all who lived in the cities, and whatever grew on the ground (Genesis 19:24-25 GW). As mentioned in a previous post, it is not our place to judge other people. That is the Lord’s job; and He is just. Likewise, just because we think that the people whom we deem to be wicked has not been held accountable nor faced any consequences for their actions, it does not mean that we should take it into our own hands to mete out a punishment that we feel they deserve. That job lies with the Lord. It is His job to hold people accountable for their actions. Now, knowing this, it is only our job to show lovingkindness to others. It is only our job to be willing to associate with others (including those we deem to be wicked) and engage with them and communicate with them so that they may turn from their wicked ways. And, in this way, the Lord may relent from meting out His judgment against them in a similar manner to how He relented from meting out His judgment against the people of Nineveh who turned from their wicked ways, rather than punishing them like the wicked people of Sodom and Gomorrah. But maybe you do not care about those you deem to be wicked. And maybe you are not interested in seeing those you deem to be wicked spared; instead, you want to see them perish or be punished for their actions. Well, that is just a testament of your heart (or lack thereof). The Lord cares about all and wants all to be spared, including the wicked. Therefore, we must be willing to associate with and engage with those we deem to be wicked so that they may turn from their wicked ways. And when those we deem to be wicked turn from their wicked ways, they shall stop from doing the wicked actions that affected people. And likewise, those who did the wicked actions may try to make amends with the people who were affected by their wicked ways. And that, it seems, is a better outcome than punishment and perishment. God bless.","summary":"You may have no sympathy for the people whom you view as wicked, but the Lord certainly does.

        "content_text":"Charlotte Jones, the daughter of the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, invited day time talk show host and Green Bay Packers supporter Ellen DeGeneres and her spouse, Portia de Rossi, to the owner’s private suite to watch a football game between those two teams. Also invited to watch the game in the owner’s private suite were the former president of the United States of America, George W. Bush, and his wife, Laura; they were seated next to Ellen and Portia. A picture of these two pairs of people sitting beside each other began circulating on the Internet. When people saw that picture of them together, people expressed their opinions via tweets and think pieces. People expressed their discontent that the talk show host would associate with, not to mention be friends with, the former president. And the people also expressed their puzzlement as to why she would be friends with someone who has not been a friend to the LGBTQ+ community, not to mention the laundry list of other crimes, misdeeds, and abuses of power that have been cited as a reason to shun him like a leper rather than associate with him. During the monologue of her day time talk show, Ellen replied to some of the opinions expressed about her association with George. Ellen replied to them, “When we were invited, I was aware that I was going to be surrounded with people from very different views and beliefs. But just because I don’t agree with someone on everything doesn’t mean that I’m not going to be friends with them. When I say, ‘be kind to one another,’ I don’t mean be kind to the people who think the same way you do. I mean be kind to everyone.” Her reply elicited more tweets and think pieces expressing a variety of opinions, including the idea that showing unconditional kindness (or niceness) to all is a contemptible quality for a person to possess in this day and age. This is not the first time that such a situation has happened, of course. What happened to Ellen, in fact, is not too different from what happened to Jesus. A man named Levi threw a great banquet for Jesus in his home. A large number of tax collectors and others sat down to eat with them (Luke 5:29 CEB). Like Ellen, Jesus was invited by a person—in this case, Levi—to their private home for a great banquet that he was throwing. And similarly to how others (like George W. Bush) were also invited to watch the football game in the private suite, a large number of tax collectors and other disreputable people were also invited to the great banquet that was being thrown at Levi’s home. And similarly to how Ellen was seated next to George W. Bush, Jesus was seated around the other invited guests; and He ate with them. Similarly to Ellen and George, people—in this case, Pharisees and their scribes—saw Jesus seated around tax collectors and others. They expressed discontent that Jesus would be associating with such people. The Pharisees and their scribes [seeing those with whom He was associating] began murmuring in discontent to His disciples, asking, “Why are you eating and drinking with the tax collectors and sinners?” (Luke 5:30 AMP) Tax collectors, in that day and age, were seen as corrupt and traitorous. They were seen as corrupt because they would demand people to pay more taxes than necessary; and enrich themselves by keeping the difference. They were seen as traitorous by Jews because they were Jews who worked for the Romans to collect taxes from the Jews. Because of this list of misdeeds and abuses of power, people expressed puzzlement as to why Jesus would associate with tax collectors and other disreputable people. Similarly to Ellen, Jesus responded to the opinions expressed by the Pharisees and their scribes in regards to His association with the tax collectors and the sinners. Jesus replied to them, “It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but [only] those who are sick. I did not come to call the [self-proclaimed] righteous [who see no need to repent], but sinners to repentance [to change their old way of thinking, to turn from sin and to seek God and His righteousness]” (Luke 5:31-32 AMP). Similarly to Ellen, Jesus knew that He would be surrounded with people from very different views and beliefs. And like Ellen, just because Jesus doesn’t agree with someone on everything or endorse their actions doesn’t mean that He shall shun them like a leper rather than associate with them. That is because shunning and shaming people is not the way to change a person’s old way of thinking, nor is it the way to turn them from sin to seeking God and His righteousness; instead, as mentioned in a previous post, love is the way. That is why Jesus is willing to associate with and befriend tax collectors and sinners rather than shun them. In fact, such a change happened to Levi. One day, as Jesus left the town [that He was in], he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector’s booth. “Follow me and be my disciple,” Jesus said to him. So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him (Luke 5:27-28 NLT). Jesus knew that Levi was a tax collector because he was sitting at his tax collector’s booth. Therefore, Jesus surely knew that Levi was a disreputable person in the eyes of people in that day and age. Yet, Jesus did not shun Levi or shame him or ignore him as He was walking by. Instead, Jesus took the time and effort to befriend Levi. Jesus took the time and effort to compel Levi to turn from his old (sinful, corrupt) ways, and to instead seek God and His righteousness by following Jesus and becoming His disciple (student and adherer to Jesus’ teachings and practices). And that is basically what did happen. Levi got up, left everything, and followed Jesus. That does not happen if Jesus chooses to shun or shame or ignore Levi; it only happened because Jesus chose to engage with and befriend him. And I reckon that Levi invited other tax collectors and sinners to the banquet that he threw for Jesus in his home so that Jesus could have an opportunity to compel other tax collectors and sinners to turn from their old ways in the same manner that Jesus compelled Levi to. But such an opportunity would not exist if Jesus chose to shun Levi because of his disreputable character—in the same manner the people of this world think it is proper to shun disreputable people—rather than take the opportunity to engage with and befriend him. Levi was a tax collector. Corrupt and traitorous in the eyes of people in that day and age. And yet, Jesus called Levi to follow Him and be His disciple. And that is because, as it was mentioned in the previous post, you do not have to be perfect (saintly in your character, speech, and actions) before you may become a laborer for the Lord. Rather, our imperfectness is a perfect testament of God’s perfect love and forgiveness and acceptance and grace for all. For, we who are imperfect, and yet labour for the Lord, may point to ourselves and say, “I am not perfect yet God still loves me; I am not perfect yet God did not shun nor forsake me. I have done wrongs yet God has forgiven me. I am living proof of God’s love and forgiveness and acceptance and grace for all.” As an imperfect people, that is a message that we are well-equipped to spread as His emissaries. So it is sensible that Jesus would invite Levi to follow Him and be a disciple. Levi, because of his past actions, can be a living testament of the power of God’s love and forgiveness and acceptance and grace for all to change a person’s old ways of thinking and doing. In fact, Levi was not the first person of disreputable character that Jesus called to follow Him and be His disciple. Earlier, Jesus spake to a multitude of people from the boat of a fisherman named Simon Peter. When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch” (Luke 5:4 NKJV). And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking (Luke 5:6 NKJV). When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!” (Luke 5:8 NKJV) And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men” (Luke 5:10 NKJV). Simon Peter informed Jesus that he was a sinful man. And yet, Jesus did not think that made him unqualified to follow Him and be His disciple. Thus, irregardless that Simon was a sinful man, Jesus still invited him to follow Him and be His disciple. So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him (Luke 5:11 NKJV). Yes, similarly to Levi the tax collector, Simon the fisherman left everything behind and followed Him. One morning, after a night of prayer, Jesus called His disciples and selected twelve of them, whom He also named apostles (special messengers, personally chosen representatives) (Luke 6:13 AMP). (He had more than twelve disciples. And of all His disciples, He chose twelve to be apostles.) And the disciples that He chose to be apostles included Simon, whom He also named Peter (Luke 6:14 AMP) and Matthew (Levi, the tax collector) (Luke 6:15 AMP). Yes, the people Jesus chose to be His emissaries included Simon Peter the fisherman (and self-proclaimed sinful man) as well as Levi the tax collector (whom people in that day and age viewed as corrupt and traitorous). These people changed their old ways of thinking, turned from their sins, and instead sought God and His righteousness. This does not happen if Jesus chooses to shun or shame or ignore them rather than befriend them. As such, you should not shun or shame or ignore those whom you find disreputable because of their actions or views that you do not agree with. Instead, like Jesus, you should be willing to engage with them and associate with them and befriend them. For, that is the way in which you may, on the basis of love, appeal to them and compel them to change their old ways of thinking and turn from their ways and toward what is right in the eyes of the Lord. Now, I am not only suggesting this to people of this world. This suggestion is also for we who believe in Jesus. We who believe in Jesus Christ may regularly get together at a person’s home to feast and fellowship with other believers. Such gatherings are often called cell groups or life groups. That is good; keep doing that. However, we who believe in Jesus should also follow the example that He set and fellowship with those who do not know Jesus yet. If we who believe choose to only feast and fellowship with other believers, then we become no different from the Pharisees and their scribes. Rather, we who believe in Jesus should also engage with and associate with and befriend those whom people of this world deem to be disreputable so that we may, like Jesus, invite them to follow Him and become His disciple. Therefore, fellow believers in Jesus, I appeal to you, on the basis of love, to follow the example that Jesus set by putting in the time and effort to feast and to fellowship with people whom the world finds disreputable so that they may one day accept your invitation to follow Jesus and become His disciple (or, student and adherer to Jesus’ teachings and practices). For, when a person chooses to follow and adhere to Jesus teachings and practices, they choose to think and do what is right in the eyes of the Lord, rather than think and do what is sin in the eyes of the Lord. And when that happens, what wrongs can people of this world charge them with doing? Associating with a disreputable person, only, I reckon. God bless.","summary":"Showing unconditional kindness to all has become a contemptible quality for a person to possess in this day and age.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/67540997-61b0c900-f6b5-11e9-8301-6b13b8dd0ef3.jpg","date_published": "2019-10-25T00:00:00+00:00",

        "title":"The Seed Of Anger",
        "content_text":"Be angry [at sin—at immorality, at injustice, at ungodly behavior], yet do not sin; do not let your anger [cause you shame, nor allow it to] last until the sun goes down. And do not give the devil an opportunity [to lead you into sin by holding a grudge, or nurturing anger, or harboring resentment, or cultivating bitterness]. Ephesians 4:26-27 AMP As mentioned in the previous message, do not begrudge those who wronged you or did things that you do not agree with. While it is okay to be angry at sin (such as immorality, injustice, and ungodly behavior), do not let that anger lead you to sin by begrudging them and resenting them because of their action. Rather, as it was mentioned in the previous post, love and forgive them irregardless of whether or not they expressed remorse or atoned for their action. For, wouldn’t it be quite ironic (or hypocritical, perhaps) if your anger led you yourself to sin? Such a situation happened to a man named Cain. Cain presented an offering to the Lord from the land’s crops while Abel presented his flock’s oldest offspring with their fat. The Lord looked favorably on Abel and his sacrifice but didn’t look favorably on Cain and his sacrifice. Cain became very angry and looked resentful. The Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why do you look so resentful? If you do the right thing, won’t you be accepted? But if you don’t do the right thing, sin will be waiting at the door ready to strike! It will entice you, but you must rule over it.” Genesis 4:3-7 CEB Cain and Abel were brothers. Cain was a farmer whilst Abel was a shepherd. Each had a different job as each had a different calling from the Lord and purpose in life. Now, this is not too different from the members of a church. A church may be considered a family and its members may be considered siblings—brothers and sisters—in Christ. Like Cain and Abel, each member of the family may have a different job (or ministry) as each member may have a different calling from the Lord and purpose in life. For example, some members of a church may be called to be a pastor or priest whilst others may be called to be ushers. Some members of a church may be called to be a worship leader whilst other members are called to be a prophet. And similarly to Cain, members of a church may become angry and resentful. To whom was Cain’s anger and resentment directed at? I reckon that it was directed at the Lord. And why was Cain’s anger and resentment directed at the Lord? I reckon it was because the Lord looked favorably upon Abel and his sacrifice but didn’t look favorably upon Cain and his sacrifice. Both Cain and Abel laboured for the Lord. Both Cain and Abel got results from their work. Yet, the Lord favored Abel over Cain. From Cain’s perspective, this was unjust. And because of this seeming unfairness, he became very angry at the injustice and resentful of the Lord. Such a scenario may happen to members of a church. Different members of a church may labour for the Lord. Each of them may produce results. And even though each member produces results, it can seem like the Lord is favoring one member of the church over another. This perception that the Lord favors some members of a church moreso than others can manifest if it seems like the Lord blessed some members of a church moreso than others. For example, maybe the Lord has blessed a member of the church by giving them a new home or work promotion or family while another member of the church who has been praying for such things for a long time have not received such a blessing from the Lord. Then it can seem like the Lord favors one member of the church moreso than others. This may seem unjust to the seemingly unfavored members of the church. Because of this, the seemingly unfavored members of the church may become angry at this seeming injustice and resentful of the Lord. Cain let his anger linger. Cain was still angry by the time the sun went down (when he went to sleep) and Cain was still angry when the sun went up (when he arose from his slumber), thereby giving the devil an opportunity to lead him to sin. And that is what happened to Cain in this case. One day Cain suggested to his brother, “Let’s go out into the fields.” And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother, Abel, and killed him (Genesis 4:8 NLT). The seed of anger was planted within Cain. He let it linger. In the process of time, it grew and bore fruit because Cain nurtured and cultivated the seed of anger that he harbored within him. Of all people, Cain should have known that this would happen; he was a farmer! And as any farmer worth their salt knows, when you plant a seed in fertile ground, it shall grow and eventually bear fruit if you nurture and cultivate it. Now, what happened to Cain may happen to us. When we see that the Lord seemingly favours other members of the church moreso than us, the seed of anger may be planted within us. And if we allow it to linger beyond sun down, it may grow and bear fruit in the process of time as it is being nurtured and cultivated within us. And when that happens, like Cain, we may attack the brothers and sisters in Christ who seem to be favoured by the Lord moreso than us. We may not physically attack them like how Cain physically attacked Abel; rather, we may verbally attack them. And we may not kill them in a like manner to how Cain killed Abel; rather, we may try to kill different aspects of their life—such as their ministry, or their relationships, or their reputation (character assassination), and the like. Yes! The anger that leads to sin that you see happening on a macro scale in this world also happens on a micro scale in church communities. That is because people who labour for Christ in a church are no different from people who labour for a company in the world. As mentioned in the previous post, we are all humans who are imperfect and live messy lives full of mistakes, regrets, failures, pain, and trials and tribulations. And that includes those who labour for Christ in a church. This may come as a surprise to some people (believers and non-believers alike) who expect labourers for the Lord to be saintly in character, in speech, in actions, and in all spheres of their life. So it can be surprising, even disappointing, when a labourer for the Lord does not meet a person’s expectation of them. Because of this, believers can become disillusioned and turn away from the Lord. Likewise, non-believers can charge labourers and believers of the Lord with hypocrisy. Now, it may seem counterintuitive for the Lord to use us imperfect people to be His emissaries, since the Lord’s mission is for all to know and believe in Jesus. Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive to use people who others can point to as the reason that they do not believe or stopped believing. But, there is a wisdom to the Lord using us imperfect people as His emissaries, for we who are imperfect are perfect messengers of God’s love and forgiveness and acceptance and grace of all. Even though we emissaries are imperfect, God still loves us. And, even though we emissaries make mistakes, God forgives us. Even though we emissaries, through our words and actions, turn people away from God, God still welcomes and accepts us as part of His family. And even though we emissaries may fail to show grace and mercy to others, God still shows us grace and mercy. Thus, people may look at our imperfectness as a testament of God’s perfect love and forgiveness and acceptance and grace for all. A person may get fired for making a mistake whilst working as a representative for a company. (See Sacco, Justine.) In contrast, when we make a mistake whilst working as an emissary for the Lord, we shall not be canceled (fired) because the Lord does not expect us to be perfect. Thus, you should not try to cancel people because you think they are not good emissaries of Christ; nor should you try to cancel people who labour in other domains (such as politicians and athletes and celebs and leaders and members of the media and business execs and the like) as you should not expect anyone to be perfect. If you try to cancel someone because of your anger at them, then you become no different from Cain who canceled (as in, killed) Abel. You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel. Hebrews 12:24 NLT Near the beginning of this post I rhetorically asked if it would be ironic if your anger at a person led you yourself to sin. The answer, of course, is yes. The irony is that the anger that you directed at the people who sinned in your eyes (were immoral, unjust, or behaved in an ungodly manner) can now be directed at you. The irony is that the price that you felt others should pay for their injustices can now be demanded from you. That is basically what happened to Cain after he sinned because of his anger. The blood of Abel cried out for vengeance against Cain. The blood of Abel cried out for Cain to pay for his actions. And that is what happened. The Lord handed out His sentence. Then Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” (Genesis 4:13-14 NIV) That, to me, is the exact same sentence that people of this world try to impose upon others who have wronged them or done things that they do not agree with. The people of this world, in this day and age, try to #cancel others by driving them away so that they live the rest of their lives hidden from the presence of and isolated from the rest of society like a restless wanderer (or vagabond). Cain thought that whoever finds him will kill him (like how he killed Abel). The Lord replied, “No, for I will give a sevenfold punishment to anyone who kills you.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain to warn anyone who might try to kill him (Genesis 4:15 NLT). And that is because it is not for other people to judge and mete out punishment for others’ sins. That is a job for the Lord. So the Lord put a mark on Cain to warn people to not take justice into their own hands by killing him. Therefore, neither should we try to take justice into our own hands by trying to cancel people. Instead, we should leave it up to the Lord because that is His job; and He is just. The blood of Abel cried out for vengeance. The blood of Jesus, however, speaks forgiveness. Because of the blood that Jesus shed on the cross, we shall not be canceled (as in forsaken or abandoned) by Him, irregardless of what other people may opine. Now, just because believers are not canceled by Jesus does not mean that believers do not face real-world consequences for their actions. We surely do! But irregardless of our mistakes, the Lord shall always love us and forgives us and accept us as part of His family, rather than driving us away and isolating us from Him like how the people of this world try to drive away and isolate from society those they want canceled. That is the message that He has given us emissaries to spread. That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed the message of reconciliation to us (2 Corinthians 5:19 HCSB). Therefore, reconcile between those who have wronged you or done things that you do not agree with, rather than counting their trespasses against them, in the same manner that the Lord has reconciled with you and not counted your trespasses against you. God bless.","summary":"The seed of anger may be planted within us.

        "title":"Retweets Do Not Imply Endorsement",
        "content_text":"For those who use Twitter, you may notice that some members of Twitterati mention in their bio that retweets do not imply endorsement or agreement. I reckon that it is the same with the Bible. For, the Bible contains stories of people who do disagreeable things that would not be endorsed according to today’s standard. For example, Abraham married his half-sister, Sarah. Abraham’s brother, Nahor, married his niece, Milcah. Milcah’s brother, Lot, is the father of his daughters’ children. That all these things are in the Bible does not necessarily imply that God endorsed or agreed with those actions by those people. They are in the Bible because those are the things that happened. If those things were left out of the Bible, then the Bible would be more like one’s Instagram profile: a filtered portrait of one’s life curated to only show the agreeable bits of one’s life while keeping hidden the disagreeable bits of one’s life. But the Bible is not like Instagram! Rather, the Bible is the story of God’s love for us humans who are imperfect and live messy lives full of mistakes, regrets, failures, pain, and trials and tribulations. Some Instagrammers and Youtubers and influencers on other social media platforms share a curated window that shows an idealized version of their lives, or, contrived perfection made to get attention, as one former social media influencer so eloquently described it, whilst trying to hide the bits of their lives that would not be agreeable or endorsed by their followers. For, as it is mentioned in a previous post, when someone decides to bring to light or accuse another person of certain actions that they deem to be disagreeable, the accused, without trial or due process, may be judged to be guilty and punished in the court of public opinion by those who heard about their actions. Indeed, this is what happened to Youtube stars who gained a following by sharing a curated window into their life as a vegan. One day, it was brought to light that those Youtubers did not follow a strict vegan diet; they instead supplemented their diet by eating fish and eggs. I reckon that those Youtubers hid the fact that they ate fish and eggs from their followers because eating such non-vegan foods would not be endorsed by their followers. And indeed, when what those Youtubers tried to keep hidden from their followers was brought to light, their followers condemned them. (Of course, social media stars are not the only public figures who only show a curated window into their lives. Other public figures—like politicians, reporters, athletes, and company executives—may do likewise. And the bits of their lives that those public figures preferred to keep hidden may be brought to light. And when that happens, the public figure may be condemned by the people who hear about it. This scenario recently happened to one such public figure when it was revealed that this person painted their face a few times.) But God is not like your social media followers. Unlike with your social media followers, you do not have to hide the disagreeable bits of your life from God lest you be judged and condemned for your disagreeable bits. For one, you cannot hide anything from God; He knows everything about you. You may be able to hide things from your friends or family or social media followers but you cannot hide anything from God. Likewise, unlike your social media followers, God shall not condemn you because of the disagreeable bits of your life nor shall He shame you or forsake you because of the bits of life that He disagrees with. Whether or not your social media followers continue to love and respect you is based on the facade (filtered view of your life) that you present to them. Once that life you present to the public is revealed to be just a facade, your social media followers stop loving and caring about you. The love that you feel from your social media followers can be fickle and fleeting since it can be conditional on their acceptance of the filtered life that you present to them. One moment, you have a multitude of adoring followers and then, when they find out about the hidden bits of your life that they do not agree with, they turn on you. They may go from a mob who admires you to a mob who attacks you. But God and His love for you is not like your followers and their love for you. God and His love for you is not fickle; He and His love for you is unchanging. God and His love for you is not fleeting; He and His love for you is unending. God and His love for you is not a function; He and His love for you is unconditional. With your social media followers, you must continually prove that you are worthy of their love and acceptance by showing that you live up to their standard. Your followers determine whether or not you can be a member of their community. In that sense, your followers are your masters. You are a slave to your followers. And as their slave, your focus is to please them. But, if they find out that you broke the rules governing acceptance into their community, then they can cancel your membership and exclude you from their community. But God is not like your social media followers. You do not have to earn or prove that you are worthy of His love. You already have it. This love is illustrated in the story of a slave, Onesimus, who ran away from his master, Philemon, and then eventually ended up crossing paths with Apostle Paul. The slave did something disagreeable in the eyes of his master. Such a disagreeable action was punishable by death. (In other words, the canceling of one’s life.) But Apostle Paul implored Philemon to welcome and accept him as you would me (Philemon 1:17 AMP), no longer as a slave, but more than a slave—as a dearly loved brother (Philemon 1:16 HCSB). Apostle Paul implored Philemon to forgive Onesimus as well as welcome and accept him as a dearly beloved brother rather than begrudging him and canceling his life for the disagreeable things that he did to him. Apostle Paul urged Philemon to do this irregardless of whether or not Onesimus showed regret or atoned for his actions. In fact, Apostle Paul told Philemon that “if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me” (Philemon 1:18 NLT) and “I will repay it” (Philemon 1:19 NLT). By telling Philemon to charge him instead of Onesimus, Apostle Paul was telling him to not require atonement from Onesimus before being willing to forgive and accept him back. In other words, do not make atonement a precondition to your forgiveness and acceptance of other people who have wronged you or done some things that you do not endorse. In fact, God did not make us atoning for our wrongs a precondition to His forgiveness and love and acceptance of us. Instead, Jesus paid the price for our wrongs (sins) against God. We did not have to pay the price. Although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right, I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. Philemon 1:8-9 HCSB Apostle Paul could have commanded Philemon to do what is right; instead, he appealed to him on the basis of love. And now, I appeal to you, on the basis of love, to follow what Apostle Paul asked Philemon to do. Instead of begrudging those who have wronged you, forgive them. And instead of condemning and canceling those who say or do things that you do not agree with or endorse, love and accept them. Shaming people is not the way to changing people. Love is the way. Shame may cause people to feel compelled to say or do something to take the heat off them. However, things done out of compulsion is not genuine. Therefore, at most, shaming makes the shamers feel good about themselves by thinking the shaming worked, and emboldens shamers to shame other people. But it does not work. It just perpetuates a self-defeating cycle. For any action to be genuine, it must be voluntary rather than forced. Apostle Paul understood this. That is why he told Philemon that he wanted to get his consent before doing something, so that his goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of his own free will (Philemon 1:14 NASB). Apostle Paul did not want Philemon to be compelled to do good and what is right; rather, he wanted it to be done by his own free will. In this way, the action would be a genuine and intentional choice rather than a forced obligation. Therefore, you should not shame people into action; instead, you should appeal to them on the basis of love. God bless.","summary":"God and His love for you is not fickle; it is unchanging.

        "content_text":"When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged. Yet having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes. Esther 3:5-6 NIV Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep themselves separate. Their customs are different from those of all other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. Esther 3:8 NIV There was a certain group of people—Jews—who were scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes. The customs of the Jews were different from all the other peoples. The Jews were different from all the other peoples in the kingdom of Xerxes because they are not native to that nation; instead, the Jews were immigrants in that nation. In this sense, the Jews of that time are not unlike immigrants of today, who build (or join existing) ethnic enclaves in the country they migrate to. Thus, Haman—a high ranking advisor in king Xerxes administration—advised the king it was not in his best interest to tolerate them (and what makes them different) or let them remain. In essence, the Jews, immigrants, were targeted by a member of the administration of king Xerxes because he thought that the Jews, immigrants, were not dropping their customs and culture in order to integrate into the customs and culture of the natives of the nation they resided in. The Jews were brought to the nation when Mordecai’s great-grandfather—Kish—had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away (Esther 2:6 NKJV). As you may recall from the previous post, this is also around the same time that Daniel and other Jews were brought to Babylon from Jerusalem after king Nebuchadnezzar besieged it. And similarly to how people working in king Xerxes administration showed hatred toward Jews of Mordecai’s generation, people working in king Nebuchadnezzar’s administration also showed malice toward the Jews of Daniel’s generation for not following the customs and culture of the natives of the nation they resided in. Daniel and Kish. They were a part of one generation of Jews, immigrants, living in Babylon during the reign of king Nebuchadnezzar. A couple of generations later, Mordecai was born as part of a newer generation of Jews living in Babylon, this time during the reign of a different leader, king Xerxes. And yet, these Jews were still persecuted and hated on by natives of Babylon and viewed differently from the natives. This preamble, of course, is all to say that what happened to the Jews, immigrants, during the days of Daniel, and a couple of generations later during the days of Mordecai, is not too different from what is happening to immigrants in this day and age in a variety of nations around the world. For example, the people in a part of India called Jammu and Kashmir had special status that made them different and separate from the rest of India. It also allowed them the autonomy to make their own laws. And then, the administration of the current leader of India decided that it is not in their best interest to continue to tolerate these people who have the special status. Therefore, the current leader of India revoked those people’s special status, under the pretense that the special status that those people had hindered their integration with the rest of India. Likewise, Hong Kong is a part of China. However, it has special status—known as one country, two systems—that gives it the autonomy to live by their own laws, separate from the laws of mainland China. Although Hong Kong is a part of China, the people of Hong Kong do not see themselves as Chinese; rather, they see themselves as different and separate from the people of mainland China. Meanwhile, in another part of China, Xinjiang, that is home to people of a certain ethnic group, the Uygurs, who have different customs from the majority of other people in China, are being targeted by the administration of the leader of China because they thought it was not in their best interest to tolerate them and their differences. A little closer to home, the current leader of the United States of America and certain people within its administration have targeted immigrants as well as those whose ethnic background is deemed by the leader and its administration to be non native to the nation. Of course, this intolerance is nothing new in the United States of America. Rather, this intolerance spans many generations, to when some people were brought to the United States of America four hundred years ago in August 1619. In this sense, the United States of America is not too different from Babylon. For, as mentioned above, Jews, immigrants, experienced persecution in Babylon at the decree of different leaders for many different generations. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up. Daniel 3:17-18 NASB Jews of Daniel’s generation could have responded to such persecution at the hands of the leader of Babylon by living in fear, or by looking to migrate to another nation that is more welcoming to them. But they did not; rather, they responded by faith in their God to deliver them from the heat that was placed on them to adopt the customs and beliefs of the natives of Babylon and forsaking their own customs and beliefs. Likewise, you who are being targeted by the leader of the nation that you are in for your customs or beliefs or ethnicity could respond to such persecution by living in fear or migrating to another nation that is more welcoming to you. But I suggest you not; instead, like the Jews of Daniel’s generation who lived in Babylon, I suggest that you respond by putting your faith in God because He can deliver you from the heat that the leader and its administration placed on you through the fiery rhetoric that they spew to inflame racial tensions and policies that they enact to set aflame the lives you built and the future you strived to build for you and your children. (For, as mentioned in a previous post, the Lord let the American Dream and its equivalent around the world become elusive so that you would turn back to Him and give Him a chance to show that He is willing and able to fight for you and save you.) And indeed, that is what happened to the Jews of Daniel’s generation. After king Nebuchadnezzar put some Jews into the midst of a burning fiery furnace, he was astonished to see that He sent His angel and rescued His servants who trusted in Him. They violated the king’s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God (Daniel 3:28 HCSB). I reckon that if you too trust in the Lord, He too shall rescue you from the tense environment that you have been put in the midst of by the leaders of the nation that you reside in. Just believe. God bless you.","summary":"Like the generations of Jews targeted in Babylon, God shall deliver you from the heat that leaders put on you through their fiery rhetoric that inflame tensions and policies that set aflame your life.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/63902669-91ef2a80-c9d8-11e9-90c8-d687f2f48e8f.jpg","date_published": "2019-08-28T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him. Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.” Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.” The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.” Daniel 2:1-6 NKJV Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had dreams. Dreams that he did not understand the meaning of. I reckon that this is because he did not have a relationship with the Lord God. As mentioned in a previous post, messages that are encrypted with a well-designed encryption scheme may not be deciphered without the decryption key. That is why those without the decryption key may see and hear the message, however what they see is in an encrypted form so they do not understand the message; rather it is without meaning to them. Only those with the decryption key may understand the message. And the decryption key is held by the One who encrypted the message. In this case, Jesus. Because Nebuchadnezzar did not have a relationship with the Lord God, he did not have the decryption key to decipher his dream. Thus, Nebuchadnezzar called upon his advisers—magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans—in hopes that they would be able to tell him his dream and give him the interpretation. However, they too were not able to. I reckon that this is because they too did not have a relationship with the Lord God. As was mentioned in a previous post, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God, He may tell you what is to come and forewarn you when something will result in the death of you or some aspect in your life. Such a forewarning may have been beneficial to them so that they may have avoided being cut into pieces (death of their health) as well as having their houses made an ash heap (destruction of their homes) as a consequence of not being able to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream and give him the interpretation. Daniel went at once to see the king and requested more time to tell the king what the dream meant. Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened. He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling them the secret, so they would not be executed along with the other wise men of Babylon. That night the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven. Daniel 2:16-19 NLT Then Daniel went in to see Arioch, whom the king had ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him, “Don’t kill the wise men. Take me to the king, and I will tell him the meaning of his dream.” Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king and said, “I have found one of the captives from Judah who will tell the king the meaning of his dream!” Daniel 2:24-25 NLT Nebuchadnezzar could not interpret the dream; nor could the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans. And because of this, Nebuchadnezzar decreed that all of the wise men be executed. And so, Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, went forth to carry out Nebuchadnezzar’s command. When one of the wise men—Daniel—found out about the king’s decree, he went to see the king and requested some time to tell the king his dream and what it meant. That night, the Lord God revealed the secret to Daniel in a vision. I reckon that this is because Daniel had cultivated a relationship with the Lord God, unlike Nebuchadnezzar and the magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans. Daniel. Daniel is not a native of Babylon; rather, he was originally from Jerusalem. He was brought to Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem and besieged it. He was brought to Babylon from Jerusalem because he was deemed to have the potential to serve in the king’s palace, given a couple of years of training in the language and literature of the Babylonians. And that is what he did. Daniel served in the king’s palace for a multitude of years. In essence, Daniel, an immigrant, became a net positive contributor in the new country that he found himself in rather than being a drain in his new country of residence. Daniel is a testament to how investing in helping newcomers integrate in their new country of residence can, over the long run, help them become a net positive contributor to the country that welcomed them. Daniel the immigrant became a net positive contributor to his new country of residence, Babylon, by being able to do something that the natives of Babylon could not: tell the king his dreams and give him the interpretation. Daniel the immigrant had skills in an area that the natives of Babylon did not. In essence, there was a skills gap in the nation of Babylon. Daniel did not steal a job from a native of Babylon because the natives did not have the expertise to fill that job; instead, Daniel the immigrant filled a role that could not be filled by the natives of Babylon. Therefore, Daniel the immigrant added on whilst not taking anything away from other elements of the nation of Babylon. In this day and age, some people view immigrants as a drain on the society that they moved to. But that should not be! Instead, I reckon that immigrants should be viewed similarly to how Daniel was viewed—someone with the potential to integrate and become a net positive contributor in their new habitat over the long run. Daniel was not viewed as an invasive species that overruns and chokes out the native population in the habitat that they were brought into. No! Instead, Daniel was viewed as someone who was worth investing the time and resources needed to help him successfully integrate into society because he had the potential to be a net positive contributor to society, thus allowing you to recoup your initial investment over the long run. Thus, you should see immigrants in the same way that Nebuchadnezzar saw Daniel. As for those who find themselves residing in a new country: you may not understand why you find yourself residing in a new country but just believe that the Lord God has great plans for you there. And those plans may including rising up to become adviser to the leaders of the new country that you reside in, just like Daniel. Thus, just trust in the Lord God whilst navigating your way through this new country that you find yourself in. God bless.","summary":"Don't view immigrants as a drain on society.

        "content_text":"As was mentioned in previous stories, the people of Israel during the days when the sons of Samuel reigned were not content with the system that favoured the rich and the elites. This is because the people of Israel who were not a part of the elite felt like the leaders only fought for and helped those considered a part of the elite in a quid quo pro, thus exacerbating the inequality between those who are rich and poor, elite and not elite. Thus, the people of Israel wanted change. However, instead of turning to their God to fight for them and save them from this system of corruption and inequality that was created, the people of Israel desired an outsider to become their leader. Thus, they elected Saul to become their leader who would fight for them even though the people of Israel already have a God who has proven, time and again, able and willing to fight for them and save them when they ask Him to help and save them. One such time was during the days when the people of Israel lived in Egypt. In the days when they lived in Egypt, there arose a new king who did not know Joseph and all that he did. This new king felt like the people of Israel threatened the Egyptians’ way of life. This is because the Egyptian race was always the dominant race in Egypt whilst the people of Israel were of the minority race of immigrants living in Egypt. However, in the process of time the people of Israel grew and multiplied, threatening the Egyptians as the dominant race in society. The king of Egypt felt like if the trend continued, then the Egyptians would lose their way of life and position as the dominant race in society as the people of Israel would become the dominant race in Egypt. And so, in response to this fear, the new king of Egypt enacted nationalist policies that favoured the Egyptians (the dominant, native race in Egypt) over the Israelites (the immigrants and minority, non-native race in Egypt), thereby exacerbating the inequality between the races. This was done out of fear to preserve the Egyptians’ way of life and ensure that they continue to be the dominant race in Egypt whilst the people of Israel continued to be the minority and powerless race in Egypt. Because of the nationalist policies that were enacted, the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help. Their cry for help rose up to God. As a response to their cries for help, the Lord said to Moses (who had fled from Egypt to Midian after the king of Egypt found out that he killed an Egyptian): Behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt” (Exodus 3:9–10 NKJV). In other words, the Lord chose a person who was a part of the immigrant minority race and got away with the killing of a native of Egypt to bring His people out of Egypt. Likewise, in this day and age, the Lord may select people to go and help those in need. The people that the Lord selects shall be imperfect, for as it was mentioned in previous stories, all are imperfect, for all have sinned. Thus, the Lord may select someone whom people of this world view as morally suspect. The Lord may select people who have broken the law (such as those who cross the border illegally, or those who have sexually assaulted others, or those who have murdered others) to help those in need. Yes, the Lord is willing to choose and use anyone for His purposes, for, if perfection were a prerequisite to being chosen and used by God, then everyone would be disqualified since all are not perfect because all have sinned. Of course, the people that He chooses has to agree to be used by Him, for as mentioned in previous stories, we all have free will and the freedom to make our own decisions, thus we may choose whether or not to be used by Him. Moses himself was initially reluctant. After the Lord shared His plans to Moses, he said in response: “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” (Exodus 3:11) Moses felt that he was unworthy of such a calling. He may have felt unworthy of such a calling because of his past actions (killing a person). Like Moses, when the Lord calls us to do something, we may feel unworthy of such a calling because of our past actions. However, we ought not to think like that! No matter what we did in the past, the Lord shall always love us. No matter what we did in the past the Lord shall never leave us. And, as mentioned above, the Lord is willing to use anyone, irregardless of their past, for His purposes. In addition to feeling unworthy, Moses also felt incapable of accomplishing what the Lord called him to do because he was slow of speech and tongue. In other words, Moses had a speech impediment. Like Moses, we too may feel like we lack the abilities that are required to do the things that the Lord asks us to do. However, we ought not to think like that! As the Lord said to Moses: “I will be with you.” Like Moses, the Lord is always with you. And as was mentioned in the previous story, the battle is the Lord’s, thus He shall fight for you so that you shall accomplish all that He calls you to do. Eventually, Moses agreed to do what the Lord called him to do. Like Moses, many of us are called by the Lord. However, unlike Moses, many of us decline to accept their calling. This may be because of the reasons stated above. It could also be because they do not want to do what the Lord calls them to do; instead, they prefer to do what they want to do, therefore they ignore the Lord’s call. However, may I suggest that you respond when the Lord calls you to do something rather than ignore the Lord or think that you are unworthy or incapable of answering His call. Instead of ignoring Him, say to Him: “Here I am.” Instead of thinking that you are unworthy, just remember that the Lord thinks you are worthy. And instead of thinking that you are incapable, just remember that the Lord is always with you. You may wonder why the Lord would select a person who murdered someone, and got away with it, to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt. To understand why the Lord chose Moses, I reckon you just have to consider your calling: Not many are wise from a human perspective, not many powerful, not many of noble birth. Instead, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen what is weak in the world to shame the strong. God has chosen what is insignificant and despised in the world—what is viewed as nothing—to bring to nothing what is viewed as something, so that no one can boast in His presence (1 Corinthians 1:26–29 HCSB). I reckon that is why the Lord chose Moses to lead His people out of Egypt. And before that, I reckon that is why the Lord chose Joseph to save the Egyptians and people of Israel during the famine. As you may recall from a previous story, Joseph was sold to Midianite traders (who took him to Egypt to sell him to an Egyptian officer named Potiphar) by his brothers because they despised him. Whilst in Egypt, Joseph was an insignificant slave who was imprisoned after being judged guilty without trial or due process when his master’s wife accused him of raping her. Although Joseph was insignificant and despised in the world, God chose him to save the Egyptians and the people of Israel from the famine. In essence, God chose an immigrant to save the native citizens—Egyptians—of the country that he migrated to (Egypt). And in addition to saving the Egyptians, Joseph saved the Israelites (his native race) from the famine as well. This is not too different from Moses. As mentioned earlier, after the Pharaoh of Egypt found out that he killed an Egyptian, Moses fled from Egypt to Midian. Whilst sitting by a well, the seven daughters of the priest of Midian came and drew water from the well to fill a trough and water their father’s flocks. Then some shepherds arrived and drove them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their flock (Exodus 2:17 HCSB). In essence, Moses migrated from Egypt to Midian because he feared for his life in Egypt. Thus, he was an immigrant in Midian. And whilst in Midian, he had an opportunity to rescue and save natives of Midian (the daughters of the priest of Midian). After the priest of Midian and father of the seven daughters heard about what Moses did for his daughters, he said to his daughters: “Why did you leave him there? Invite him to come and eat with us.” Moses accepted the invitation, and he settled there with him (Exodus 2:20–21 NLT). In other words, in addition to Moses helping the natives of Midian, a native of Midian helped Moses, a person who migrated from Egypt to Midian because he feared for his life in Egypt. Moses left everything behind when he fled Egypt. Moses had nothing when he reached the land of Midian. What if people of Midian treated Moses differently? What if the people of Midian decided to deport Moses back to Egypt rather than letting him to stay in Midian because they did not believe that he had a credible fear of returning to his home country of birth (Egypt)? If Moses was deported back to Egypt rather than granted asylum, I reckon the people who were looking to kill Moses would have done so. But, instead, the people of Midian granted this immigrant the opportunity to build a new life within the safe confines of Midian, the place that he migrated to. And in the process of time, the Lord said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead” (Exodus 4:19 ESV). Therefore, Moses needed place to live until it would be safe for him to go back to Egypt and rescue the people of his native race (Israelite) from the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. As you may have heard, there are caravans of migrants who go from one country to another with the hopes of being granted asylum to start their lives anew. Likes Moses and Joseph, these people go to another country because of their fear of persecution and their safety in their home country of origin. Like Moses and Joseph, they may leave everything behind in their home country of origin and have nothing but hope when they migrate to the new country. And like Moses and Joseph, these people may be viewed as insignificant. These people may be despised in the world. Like Moses and Joseph, the people who migrate to another country may be viewed as a killer or a rapist or some other type of criminal. Nevertheless, like Moses and Joseph, the Lord has great plans for the migrants in these caravans. Like Moses and Joseph, the Lord has chosen the migrants in these caravans to rescue the native people of the country that they migrate to. And in the process of time, in addition to helping the native people of the country that they migrate to, the migrants shall also help those people of their native race. However, in the mean time, they need a safe place to live until they may safely go back to their native land. Thus, may I suggest that you do as the people of Midian did for Moses? That you allow those who migrate to your country to stay and build a life rather than deport them back to their home country of residence because you do not believe that they have a credible fear of returning there? For, if you deport them back to their home country of residence, then those who are looking to harm them may do so. If, however, you allow them to stay and build a life in the country they migrated to, then, like Moses, they may help the native people of the country that they migrate to, and then eventually go back to help the people of their country of birth. Now, you may be wondering what they are being saved from. I reckon it is the same thing that the Egyptians needed rescuing from when Joseph migrated to Egypt—famine. And I reckon that it is the same thing people of Israel needed saving from when they were slaves in Egypt—oppression. As was mentioned in previous stories, the American Dream and its equivalent around the world has become evermore elusive to multitudes of people. The dream of securing a good-paying job through hard work and resilience that provides you with the economic means to live comfortably and raise your family in a home that you bought and have a higher standard of living than the previous generation has become scarcer to attain. In essence, that is the famine that the people of this world experience in this day and age. Likewise, as mentioned previously, the people of this world feels like the system favours those who are rich and who are considered elite. And the people of this world feel like the system has exacerbated the inequality between the rich and the poor, the elite and those who are not considered the elite, and those of the dominant race in the nation and those of the minority race in the nation. In a sense, the people feel oppressed by the system. The people of this world feel like they are being kept down by this unjust system. And the people of this world feel like the system is the cause for their uncomfortable life full of distresses, anxieties, and the like. Like the people of Israel in Egypt, the Lord has heard your cries for help. Also, the Lord has seen the oppression with which you have been oppressed by. The Lord is not going to stand idly by and do nothing about it. Not at all! The Lord shall do something. The Lord shall send people like Moses and Joseph before him, whom He has chosen, to deliver you from the oppression that you are under and bring you to a place of abundance. Now, this does not mean the Lord plans to send people to lead you out of your current country of residence to reside in some other country in a similar manner to how Moses brought the people of Israel out of Egypt to lead them to Canaan. No! What this means is that the Lord plans to bring you out of your current place, as in situation, in life (a place of famine and oppression and anxieties and ill comfort) and lead you to a place/situation in life that is full of abundance. In other words, whilst your physical location may not change, your lot in life shall change from a situation of distress and famine to a situation of success and abundance. Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? James 2:5 NIV You may wonder why the Lord allowed such a famine and oppression to happen in the first place. It is so that people would turn back to the Lord. That is what happened as a result of the children of Israel’s oppression at the hands of the Egyptians. It is what shall happen in this day and age. Before the king of Egypt enacted those nationalist policies, the people of Israel were living comfortable and peaceful lives in Egypt that allowed them to grow and multiply. And then, out of a fear of losing their place as the dominant race in society, the king of Egypt enacted nationalist policies to ensure that the minority race stayed powerless and oppressed, thereby exacerbating inequality. Now, if the king of Egypt did not enact such oppressive policies, then the people of Israel would continue to be living a comfortable life in Egypt. Because the people of Israel would still be able to build a life of comfort, they would have no reason to cry out to the Lord for help. However, the enactment of these policies made building a comfortable and peaceful life by themselves elusive, if not impossible. In essence, the Lord allowed them to be poor in the eyes of the world through the famine and oppression so that the people of Israel would become rich in faith in the Lord. Now, this is similar to why the Lord allowed such a famine and oppression to happen in this day and age. For generations, it had been possible to attain the American Dream and its equivalent around the world. For generations, It had been possible to have a higher standard of living than the previous generations. For generations, it had been possible to live comfortably and raise a family in a home you bought because you were able to secure a well-paying job through your own hard work and resilience. Then, in the process of time, policies were adopted that made the American Dream and its equivalent around the world evermore elusive to all except those who are the rich and the elite. If the American Dream and its equivalent around the world was still possible to attain by themselves, rather than elusive to those who are not considered a part of the rich and the elite, then the people of this world would have no reason to cry out to the Lord for help; rather, the people of this world would continue to strive to attain the American Dream and build for themselves a comfortable life. Therefore, the Lord let the American Dream and its equivalent around the world to become elusive so that people would turn back to the Lord. And the Lord had made the people of this world poor in their ability to attain the American Dream so that the people of this world would become rich in faith in the Lord rather than continue to put their faith in themselves and their own abilities to attain the American Dream. Yes, there is a reason that the Lord has allowed the things that are happening around this world. It is so that people would turn back to the Lord. It is so that the people of this world would put their faith in the Lord. Thus, if you are a person whose dream has become more elusive to attain through faith in your own abilities and resilience, may I suggest that you put your faith and reliance in the Lord to help you go from a place of famine and oppression to a place of abundance and comfort. Likewise, do not despise the immigrants living in the country nor the caravan of migrants that may arrive and seek asylum. Instead, as mentioned in a previous story, you should welcome them in your home and show them extraordinary kindness and generosity because the Lord has great plans for them. And those plans may include helping the native people of the country that they migrate to as well as the people of their native race. For, as mentioned in a previous story, when you bless them, you shall be blessed by them in return. God bless.","summary":"The Lord made people poor in their ability to attain the American Dream so that they would become rich in faith in the Lord instead of rich in faith in their own ability.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/53928036-af10f500-4056-11e9-9032-c6db26a5dd13.png","date_published": "2019-02-13T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"As it was mentioned in the previous story, the people of Israel wanted change. The people of Israel wanted a leader who would fight for them and save them even though they already had a God who has proven, time and again, that He is able to fight their battles and save them from their struggles. The people of Israel chose Saul as the man who would lead them and fight their battles and save them. So how did that go for the people of Israel? To find out, let us look at one of the battles that the people of Israel experienced and were in need of saving from. During the days of the reign of Saul, the people of Israel were at war with the Philistines. One day, the Philistines gathered their armies to battle the people of Israel. In response to this, Saul gathered together his army. The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them (1 Samuel 17:3 NKJV). One of the persons who was in the Philistine army was a man named Goliath, whose height was six cubits and a span, or over nine feet in today’s unit of measure. In other words, Goliath was a giant. Every day, once in the morning and again in the evening, Goliath would taunt the people of Israel. He would shout at them, “Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us” (1 Samuel 17:8–9 NKJV). This is not too different from the people of this world in this day and age. People in this day and age also wanted a leader who would fight for and save them even though there already is a God who is able to fight their battles and save them from their struggles. Therefore, in a multitude of countries, the citizens of those countries elected an outsider to be their leader to fight for and save them. Like the people of Israel, you may be in a battle. As mentioned in the previous story, you may be battling a precarious financial situation. And this precarious financial situation may be due to another battle: precarious job opportunities. You may need saving from a sickness. And you may need saving from your struggles with depression. You may need saving from loneliness. Or you may need saving from bullies at school. It may seem like you are battling a whole army of challenges. And like Goliath, the struggles that you are battling may taunt you every day. They may taunt you in the mornings when you wake up, and they may taunt you in the evenings as you lay in bed. Similarly to Goliath and the Philistine army, the things that you are struggling with may be a barrier to moving forward in your life. For, like Goliath, the thing that you are struggling with may seem too big for you to overcome. This is not too different from the people of Israel. For, when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid (1 Samuel 17:11 NKJV). People of Israel were dismayed and greatly afraid of the challenge that was before them. It was a challenge that was too big for them to overcome. This challenge was like a barrier preventing them from moving forward in their lives. For such a scenario, the people of Israel desired a new leader. The people of Israel desired a new leader who would fight their battles and save them. So here is a perfect opportunity for Saul, their new leader, to rise up to the challenge and fight Goliath and save the people of Israel. That is the raison d’etre for Saul’s ascension as leader of the people of Israel. So what did Saul do with this challenge that the people of Israel were facing? Did Saul fight for them? Did Saul save them? No, he did not. Saul did not fight for them nor did he save them from the challenges before them. Instead, like the people of Israel, he was dismayed and greatly afraid when he heard the words of Goliath, the Philistine that was before them. Likewise, people of this world elected outsiders to become their leader to fight for and save them from the challenges that are before them by draining the swamp of corruption and changing the system that favours the rich and elite. For, as it was mentioned in the previous story, people think that this system of corruption that fosters such favouritism resulted in the American Dream and its equivalent around the world to become evermore elusive and impossible to attain. Likewise, people think that the American Dream and its equivalent around the world has become evermore elusive to achieve because the system has reduced the availability of well-paying jobs, resulting in their current struggle to live comfortably and raise a family in a home that they own. In other words, the current system of inequality is the Goliath that the people of this world face in this day and age. People of this world think that if they are able to slay the Goliath that is the current system of corruption and inequality, then the rest of their struggles may be subdued in a similar manner to how the Philistines would become servants to the people of Israel if they are able to prevail against Goliath and kill him. Nevertheless, like Saul, the leader that they elected shall not save them from the challenges that they face. Instead, like Saul, the leaders shall not be able to overcome the Goliath that they were elected to fight because the system is too big for it to be overcome by one person alone. As it was mentioned in the previous story, instead of turning to the leader that you elected to fight your battles and save you from the challenges that you are facing, you should turn to the Lord to fight your battles and save you from the challenges that you face. That is what a young man named David did. He was the youngest of eight sons that a person named Jesse had. One day Jesse said to David, “Take this basket of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and carry them quickly to your brothers. And give these ten cuts of cheese to their captain. See how your brothers are getting along, and bring back a report on how they are doing” (1 Samuel 17:17–18 NLT). And so that is what David did. As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, came out from the Philistine ranks. Then David heard him shout his usual taunt to the army of Israel (1 Samuel 17:23 NLT). Whilst at the camp speaking to his brothers, David encountered the Goliath that the army of Israel faced. Whilst at the camp, David was taunted by the same challenge that the army of Israel was taunted by. And as mentioned previously, all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid (1 Samuel 17:24 ESV). On the other hand, when David saw the challenge and heard its taunts, he did not flee nor was he afraid. Instead, David said to Saul, “Don’t let anyone be discouraged by him; your servant will go and fight this Philistine!” (1 Samuel 17:32 HCSB) David’s confidence to overcome the challenge that is before him is not based on his own ability. It is, instead, based on his faith that the Lord is able to fight for him and save him from the challenges that he faces. For, when confronted by the Goliath challenge that was right in front of him, David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted. This day the Lord will hand you over to me, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that this entire assembly may know that the Lord does not save with the sword or with the spear; for the battle is the Lord’s and He will hand you over to us” (1 Samuel 17:45–47 AMP). David’s confidence to overcome the challenge that is before him is based on his faith that the Lord shall hand the challenge over to him because the battle is the Lord’s, therefore it is the Lord who fights for him and saves him. And when the Lord defeats the Goliath that was before him, then the challenge that was before him shall be no more. Also, the other challenges (rest of the Philistine army) that accumulated from of the primary challenge (Goliath) shall also be overcome through faith in the Lord. This faith that David has in the Lord to fight the battles that he faces and save him is not unfounded; it is based on his prior experiences. For, as David said to Saul before facing the Goliath challenge that was in front of him, “The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine” (1 Samuel 17:37 HCSB). David had prior experience with the Lord saving him when he encountered challenges (bears and lions) in his life. Thus, when another challenge (Goliath) arose in his life, he was confident that the Lord would fight for him and save him, similarly to how the Lord fought for him and saved him when he encountered prior challenges. As mentioned in the previous story, there is a reason that the Lord allowed the American Dream and its equivalent around the world to become more elusive and impossible to achieve. It is not so that the people of this world would turn to the leaders that they elected to fight for them and save them. No! It is so the people of this world would turn back to the Lord. It is to give the people of this world an opportunity to put their faith in the Lord and trust that He is able to fight for and save them. It is to give the people of this world a chance to experience the Lord fighting for and saving them from a challenge that they encounter, similarly to how David experienced the Lord fighting for and saving him from a challenge that he encountered. For, when the people of this world experiences the Lord fighting for and saving them from one challenge, then they may learn to trust in the Lord to fight subsequent battles and save them from subsequent challenges since they have prior experience in a similar manner to how David trusted the Lord to fight for him and save him when he encountered a Goliath challenge since he had prior experience with the Lord fighting for him and saving him from other challenges (the bear and the lion). Besides helping you to overcome the challenges that you face, there is another reason that the Lord wants you to experience Him fighting for you and saving you. It is, as David said to Goliath, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel who saves. For, if others know that there is a God who saves because they heard about your experience with the Lord saving you from the challenges that you encounter, then they may also give the Lord an opportunity to save them from any challenges that they may encounter. Thus, if you are struggling with a challenge that you are facing, may I suggest that you give the Lord an opportunity to fight for you and save you. For, when you do that, you shall experience the Lord saving you from the challenge that you face. And when He does that, you shall realize that there is a God who is able and willing to save. And you shall realize that there is a God whom you can turn to fight for and save you whenever you encounter a challenge. All you have to do is give the Lord one chance, one opportunity. Will you give it to Him? I suggest you do. God bless.","summary":"The Lord let the American Dream become elusive so that you would turn back to Him and give Him a chance to show that He is willing and able to fight for and save you.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/53145591-bfad6f80-356e-11e9-813e-fda05dcf15a6.jpg","date_published": "2019-01-23T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"In previous stories, the obstacles and difficulties that migrants experience as they journey from their home country of residence to another country with the hopes of being granted asylum to start their lives anew were mentioned. It was also mentioned that these migrants may decide to undertake this perilous journey, regardless of the obstacles and difficulties that they may encounter, because of the dangers and persecution and insecurities that they face in their home country of residence. You may view the migrants’ choice to leave their home country of residence as similar to the people of Israel’s choice to leave Egypt due to the hardships that they encountered, with the hopes of starting anew in a good and large land flowing with milk and honey (Canaan). In other words, a land of abundance. Like the migrants of this day and age, the people of Israel faced obstacles and difficulties along their journey to a new beginning in life. Of course, migrants are not the only ones who feel insecure about their life and the future that they and their children may enjoy. In fact, in this day and age, multitudes of people feel insecure about their (and their children’s) life and future because, in this day and age, it appears to be more elusive to achieve the American Dream of raising a family in a house that you own due to the fulfilling job that you were able to secure through years of hard work and resilience, resulting in a higher standard of living when compared to your parents. Of course, this elusiveness is not limited to those who live in America. According to an article describing a report, this elusiveness is prevalent across a multitude of developed countries. According to the article: The report by the Resolution Foundation paints a gloomy picture for all young adults across the developed world—apart from the Nordic countries. It highlights how incomes are depressed, jobs scarce and home ownership is slumping for the millennial generation compared with the baby boomers that preceded them. Because the prospect of a secure life and future elude those residing in countries classified as developed, you may reason that such a prospect also eludes those who live in a country classified as developing. For example, it has been suggested that one of the factors that caused the Arab Spring was young people’s frustrations that stemmed from the indignity of being educated yet lacking for money and employment opportunities. According to a more recent report, the prospect of a secure life and future remain elusive to young adults in the birthplace of the Arab Spring. For, over the past eight years, successive Tunisian governments have failed to create enough jobs for the educated, to address pressing needs ranging from housing to health services, and also provide for society’s rising expectations. In Tunisia, more than a third of young people between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four are unemployed. Yes, from one end of the earth to the other, people share a sense of frustration and insecurity over their (and their children’s) life and future because of the lack of job opportunities that provide them with the economic means to live comfortably in a home they bought to raise their family. For, they see that the job opportunities that are available are unstable. Nor do they provide a salary that allows them to live comfortably; instead, people are living paycheque to paycheque and are unable to save up money to buy their own home, let alone save for retirement and emergencies that may arise unexpectedly. This sense of frustration and insecurity is experienced by people across a multitude of countries that are at various stages of development along with varying histories, races and ethnicities, cultures, and religious beliefs. In other words, this sense of frustration and insecurity that has become prevalent around this world is nondiscriminatory. And in a similar manner to how the frustration of young people fuelled the Arab Spring, resulting in the toppling of the leaders and elites and establishment figures who are considered a part of the problem, so too do people in other countries, fuelled by their frustrations, desire to replace the leaders and elites and other government establishment figures with those who promise change. Now, this perspective on what is happening around the world is not new. Other people have also opined that: In countries around the world—France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others—voters are suddenly backing candidates that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. And these are not isolated events. What you are watching is entire populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives. In the United States, Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. And in the most recent election in Brazil, what was unthinkable happened when Bolsonaro surfed a tsunami of popular anger and despair that swept away the entire Brazilian political system, along with the old party leaders. He was able to do so because of the people’s growing suspicion that representative democracy is incapable of delivering what they need. This is reminiscent to what happened in the past. In the past, there was a man named Samuel, who was judge (leaders were called judges in those days and ages) over the people of Israel. As Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel. But they were not like their father, for they were greedy for money. They accepted bribes and perverted justice (1 Samuel 8:1,3 NLT). The sons of Samuel were corrupt. They used their office and position of power for personal gain. They perverted justice by accepting bribes in order to enrich themselves. In other words, those who are able to give them money would be favoured over those who are not able to give them money. And those who could give them money could receive special treatment and benefits that would not be available to those who are not able to give them money. In essence, the sons of Samuel operated a pay for play system. Now, this is not too different from the leaders of this day and age who are in government. The leaders of this day and age may also use the office that they have been elected to and position of power for personal gain. And these leaders may pervert justice by accepting money from people (or corporations or foreign state actors). While the leaders in government of this day and age might not receive the money directly, they may receive it indirectly in the form of campaign contributions and donations to non-profits and other institutions connected to those leaders. In return for giving them money, they may receive favours that are not available to those who do not give money to the leaders. The favours may include special access to those in power; preferential treatment, such as the enactment of legislation that benefits their company or industry; and other benefits, such as the awarding of no-bid government contracts. In a sense, it is as if the leaders in government only care about themselves (and their family) as well as those who can afford to give them money, while not caring about those who do not give the leaders any money. But that ought not to be! For, as it was mentioned in the previous story, you should show extraordinary kindness and generosity to those with needs without expecting anything in return. Whether or not you show extraordinary kindness and generosity to others ought not be dependent on their ability to give you something in return. Instead, you ought to be equally kind and generous to all, irregardless of their ability to return the favour. This is the injustice that the people of this world sees in this day and age. This is also the injustice that people in that day and age saw as well. Therefore, all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, and said to him, “You are old and your sons do not follow in your ways; appoint for us, then, a king to govern us, like other nations” (1 Samuel 8:4–5 NRSV). All the elders of Israel desired change. They wanted to drain the swamp of corruption that favours the rich and elites by appointing an outsider to be their leader in government. Now, this is not too different from what has been happening in this day and age. Similarly to the elders of Israel, the people in this day and age desire for change. And like the elders of Israel, the people in this day and age want to drain the swamp of corruption that favours the rich and elite. And similarly to the elders of Israel, the people of this day and age think that electing outsiders to be their leader shall accomplish that goal. Now, during the election process, the general populace may get to know these outsiders who are running to be their leader in terms of their character, personality, beliefs, and platform. During this discovery process, the general public may have been forewarned about what would happen if these outsiders were elected as their leader. The general public were forewarned that the election of these outsiders would result in the draining of civil liberties rather than the draining of the swamp. Yet, irregardless of these warnings, many of these outsiders were elected leader. Now, this is not too different from what happened when the elders of Israel wanted an outsider to become leader over the people of Israel. The elders of Israel were forewarned about what would happen if an outsider were to be their leader. For, the Lord told Samuel to solemnly forewarn them, and show them the behaviour of the king who will reign over them (1 Samuel 8:9 NKJV). And if you read the next couple of verses in this Biblical story, then you shall read that Samuel had forewarned them that their civil liberties would be curtailed. The people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles” (1 Samuel 8:19–20 NIV). People of Israel, during the time when Samuel’s sons were leader, decided to dismiss the forewarnings that they heard. The people of Israel still wanted an outsider to become their king. Therefore… Samuel called the people to assemble before God at Mizpah. He addressed the children of Israel, “This is God’s personal message to you: “I brought Israel up out of Egypt. I delivered you from Egyptian oppression—yes, from all the bullying governments that made your life miserable. And now you want nothing to do with your God, the very God who has a history of getting you out of troubles of all sorts. “And now you say, ‘No! We want a king; give us a king!’ “Well, if that’s what you want, that’s what you’ll get! Present yourselves formally before God, ranked in tribes and families.” 1 Samuel 10:17–19 MSG The people of Israel think that their leaders do not fight for them. Instead, the people of Israel think that the leaders only fight for special interest groups and elites who are able to give them money. Therefore, the people of Israel wanted a leader to fight their battles and save them even though they have a God who has proven, time and again, that He is able to do likewise. For the same reason the general populace of a multitude of countries decided to elect outsiders to become their leader. For, the citizens of those countries think that their leaders do not fight for them. Instead, the citizens of those countries think that their leaders only fight for the special interest groups and elites who give them money. And so, they want a leader who shall fight for them and save them from the hardships that they face even though there is already a God who is able to fight for them and save them from all the trials and tribulations and adversities and miseries and pains and sufferings that they may face in their life. This may not too different from those who choose to migrate to another country. Those who migrate to another country also want to be saved from all the hardships that they face in their native country of residence. The only difference is the strategy that was employed. One group hoped that migrating to another place would offer them salvation from the hardships they encounter while the other group hoped that the election of an outsider to be their leader would offer them salvation from the hardships that they encounter. But that ought not to be! All of us should turn to the Lord to fight our battles and save us rather than fight our own battles. Now, a battle may refer to things that we are struggling with. For example, as mentioned above, we may be battling a precarious financial situation. And this precarious financial situation of ours may be due to another battle: precarious job opportunities. We might need saving from a sickness that we are battling. Or we might need saving from our struggle with depression. We might need saving from loneliness. Or we might need saving from bullies at school. Whatever the battle that we may be facing, we have a choice to make: to turn to the Lord to fight our battles and save us, or to try and fight our battles ourselves. I suggest for you to turn to the Lord to fight your battles for you. And you do that by seeking and following His battle plan. And when you do that, you shall overcome every challenge that you are struggling with. The people of Israel in the days of Samuel decided not to turn to the Lord God to fight their battles. Instead, the people of Israel decided to follow their own plans to overcome the challenges they are battling. This is not too different from the people of this day and age. For, attaining the American Dream and its equivalent around the world is predicated on the reliance of your own capabilities and resourcefulness to overcome any obstacles and difficulties. However, this self-reliance is incongruous with relying upon the Lord to fight your battles for you by seeking and following His battle plan. For, striving to attain the American Dream and its equivalent around the world has resulted in a populace who have rejected the Lord and His ability to help you and a populace that have turned away from relying on the Lord. Instead, it resulted in people whose faith is in themselves and whose reliance is on their own abilities to overcome any obstacles. However, the Lord desires for all of us to turn our hearts back toward Him. And the Lord desires for each and every one of us to have faith in Him and trust in Him and rely on Him. Therefore, the Lord has allowed the American Dream and its equivalent across the globe to become so elusive in order for each and every one of us to turn our heart back to Him. The Lord has allowed the American Dream and its equivalent across the globe to become elusive so that the people of this world would turn to Him to fight their battles and save them from the struggle that they experience. Therefore, do not fight your own battles. Instead, turn your heart back to the Lord and let Him fight your battles for you. When you do that, you shall overcome every challenge that you are struggling with. God bless.","summary":"The American Dream is based on relying on your ability and resourcefulness to overcome challenges.

        "content_text":"The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, “Have courage! For as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.” Acts 23:11 HCSB As mentioned in the previous story, each and every one of us are on a journey in this life. The certain man was on a journey from Jerusalem to Jericho. And the certain priest, Levite, and certain Samaritan who came across that certain man were on a journey from one place to another. And today, we shall see that Apostle Paul was also on a journey. Apostle Paul was on a journey from Jerusalem to Rome since the Lord planned for him to testify regarding Him in Rome, similarly to how he testified about Him in Jerusalem. In this journey of his, Apostle Paul encountered some obstacles. For one, whilst in Jerusalem, a mob of people conspired with the chief priests and elders to ambush and kill him. The chief priests and elders, along with the rest of the council, planned to suggest to the commander of the Roman troops to bring Apostle Paul to them so that they may make further inquiries concerning him. (For, at this point in his life, Apostle Paul was being held in a barrack.) And if they did that, then a mob of people planned to ambush and kill him. This may not be too different from the certain man from the previous story who was attacked and beaten by thieves that ambushed him. The difference is that Apostle Paul did not fall for their plans since the son of Paul’s sister heard of their [planned] ambush, and he went to the barracks and told Paul (Acts 23:16 AMP). In other words, Apostle Paul was told in advance that doing a certain something (going to testify in front of the chief priests and elders) would surely result in his death. The certain man, on the other hand, was not forewarned that he would fall among thieves whilst on his journey, resulting in the death of his health. I reckon this is because Apostle Paul had cultivated a relationship with the Lord God whilst the certain man had not built a relationship with the Lord God. For, as it was mentioned in a previous story, when you build a relationship with the Lord God, He may forewarn you when doing something shall certainly result in death (not necessarily of your life but maybe some aspect of your life) so that you may avoid doing that which shall certainly result in death. Apostle Paul was forewarned about the mob’s intention to ambush and kill him. And because he listened to this forewarning, he was able to avoid certain death by informing the commander of the Roman troops about the mob’s planned ambush. For, when the commander of the Roman troops was informed of the mob’s intention to ambush and kill Apostle Paul, he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get ready to leave by nine o’clock tonight for Caesarea with two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen. Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Felix the governor” (Acts 23:23–34 NRSV). And after Apostle Paul was escorted to Caesarea, he stayed there for a couple of years as a prisoner for his beliefs. When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. Acts 27:1 NIV At some point in time, it was decided that Apostle Paul should sail to Italy. Therefore, he and other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius. They encountered some strong headwinds along their journey. Now, this may not be too different from us. Along our journey, we too may face some obstacles or winds that threaten to impede and slow our progress. Of course, as mentioned previously, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God, He may warn you in advance when doing something shall certainly result in death. Paul had built a relationship with the Lord God. From this relationship that he built, Apostle Paul saw that the voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also their lives. Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul (Acts 27:10–11 NKJV). As mentioned in previous stories, the Lord God may tell you one thing whilst other people (such as friends, family, or colleagues) may tell you something else. When that happens, you have a choice to make: to believe and follow the advice that the Lord God gave you or believe and follow the advice that others gave you. I recommend for you to always believe and follow the advice that the Lord God gives you. However, the centurion chose to believe and follow the advice of the helmsman and the owner of the ship. Thus, they continued on their journey. And because of their decision, their journey faced obstacles and difficulties and disasters and much loss. This is not to imply that all obstacles and difficulties and disasters and losses that you experience are a result of not believing and following the advice that the Lord God gave to you. For, as mentioned in a previous story, sometimes things ought to happen in a certain way so that God’s plans for your life may come to pass. And when this is the case, you have a choice to make: to put your trust in the Lord God by following His way to fulfill His plans for your life, or for you to not trust in the Lord God. I recommend that you trust in the Lord God, even though you may not understand what He asks of you. Before heading down to Jerusalem, Apostle Paul was with companions. While with them, he was forewarned about what would happen if he were to go there when a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. And coming to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles’” (Acts 21:10–11 NASB). Apostle Paul was forewarned that he would be bounded in Jerusalem and imprisoned. Given this information, he had a decision to make: to trust in the Lord God and follow His plans for his life, or to not trust in the Lord God. I recommend that you always trust in the Lord God. Apostle Paul chose to trust in the Lord God by going down to Jerusalem even though he was aware of the difficulties that were to come in his life. I suggest you do likewise. Apostle Paul could have decided not to go to Jerusalem and thus avoid the difficulties that awaited him. Likewise, you can decide to avoid going down a certain path that you know is fraught with difficulties. In other words, you may choose the easy route. However, deciding to take the easy route may result in the plans that the Lord God has for your life not being fulfilled. Likewise, if Apostle Paul chose the easy route by not going down to Jerusalem to avoid the difficulties that he would have experienced, then the plans that the Lord God had for his life may not have been fulfilled. Once ashore, we then learned that the island was called Malta. The local people showed us extraordinary kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all in, since it was raining and cold. Acts 28:1–2 HCSB The ship that Apostle Paul and other prisoners, sailors, centurion, and soldiers were on ran aground on a certain island. Once they were ashore, they learned that the island was called Malta. which is not their intended destination. Their intended destination was Italy. However, along the way they strayed from their journey and became lost as they encountered obstacles and difficulties. This may not be too different from us. We too may stray and get lost along our journey in life as we encounter some obstacles and difficulties. And this is not too different from the certain man who faced difficulties whilst on his journey from Jerusalem to Jericho. As mentioned in the previous story, after the certain man fell among thieves, a couple of people came across him: a certain priest, a Levite, and a certain Samaritan. When the certain priest and Levite encountered the certain man, they ignored him and avoided him. Similarly to the certain priest and Levite, the local people of Malta could have ignored and avoided the people who were aboard the ship that ran aground on their island. However, they did not. Instead, like the certain Samaritan, when the local people of Malta encountered the people from the ship that ran aground, they showed extraordinary kindness to them, for they lit a fire and took them all in since it was raining and cold. In addition to kindling a fire, they welcomed them and entertained them hospitably. And when they were ready to continue their journey to their intended destination, the local people of Malta furnished them with the supplies that they needed. Similarly to the local people of Malta, you too may come across people who have strayed from their destination and become lost while on their journey because of the obstacles and difficulties that they have faced. And when you do that, you have a decision to make: to help those whom you encounter who are in need of help in a similar manner to how the local people of Malta (and the certain Samaritan when he came across the certain man who fell among thieves) did, or to ignore and avoid those people in a similar manner to how the certain priest and Levite ignored and avoided the certain man. I suggest that you follow the example of the local people of Malta by helping those whom you encounter who are in need of help by showing them extraordinary kindness and providing for their needs. Not only would you be a blessing to those people, you would also be blessed by those you help. For, the chief official of the island was a man named Publius. As it happened, Publius’s father was ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in and prayed for him, and laying his hands on him, he healed him. Then all the other sick people on the island came and were healed (Acts 28:8–9 NLT). For, in addition to being a blessing to those on the ship that ran aground, the local people of Malta were also blessed. Publius’s father was healed and all the other sick people on the island were healed. The local people of Malta were all blessed in a different manner to the blessings that they gave to the people who were on the ship. The people who were aboard the ship were blessed by the local people of Malta’s extraordinary kindness and generosity. The local people of Malta were blessed vis-à-vis healing of their sicknesses. Similar to the local people of Malta, when you show extraordinary kindness and generosity to people in need whom you encounter, you shall be blessed. Maybe not in the same manner that you bless others, but in a different manner. (Now, just to be clear: you should not expect to receive anything in return when you show extraordinary kindness to those who are in need. Although the local people of Malta were blessed for showing extraordinary kindness and generosity to the people who were on the ship, they did not expect to receive anything in return. Those people on the ship had nothing; all was lost in the shipwreck. Yet, the local people of Malta still showed kindness and generosity whilst expecting nothing in return. And so, do likewise.) It was three months after the shipwreck that we set sail on another ship that had wintered at the island—an Alexandrian ship with the twin gods as its figurehead. Acts 28:11 NLT Three months after getting lost and going astray from their destination because of the obstacles and difficulties that they experienced, those who were on the ship resumed their journey. Likewise, those in need whom you encounter may eventually get back on track in their journey in life because of the extraordinary kindness and generosity that you showed them. Now, one of the persons that the local people of Malta showed kindness and generosity to was Apostle Paul, whom the Lord used mightily to testify about Him to multitudes in Rome. The Lord planned to use Apostle Paul mightily for the kingdom of God. Yet, he was lost and astray from his intended destination whilst on his journey. If it were not for the local people of Malta, he may not have gotten back on track in his journey. Likewise, there are many people whom God has plans to use mightily for His kingdom. Yet, they are currently lost and have astray from their intended destination because of some obstacles and difficulties that they have encountered. And they are just in need of some help to get back on track from someone who is willing to show them extraordinary kindness and generosity. Therefore, I suggest for you to help those in need whom you encounter so that they may get back on track in their journey in life. The local people of Malta did not know that the Lord had great plans for Apostle Paul. When they first met him, they thought that he was just a murderer. And yet, irregardless of what they thought, they helped him to get back on track in his journey. And Apostle Paul was used mightily by God. In a similar manner, there are many people who God has plans to use mightily for His kingdom. Like the local people of Malta, it could be people who we judge to be murderers and the like. People who we think is undeserving of our help. However, similarly to the local people of Malta, irregardless of our judgement of others, we ought to show them extraordinary kindness and generosity, that they may get back on track in their journey, where they may be used mightily by God. As you may have heard, there are a multitude of people who journey from one place to another with the hopes of being granted asylum. And similarly to how Apostle Paul was in danger of being killed in Jerusalem, the people who make the perilous journey to seek asylum may do so because they are hated and persecuted and unsafe in their home country of residence. Along their journey, they may encounter obstacles and difficulties. In spite of the obstacles and difficulties that these people may encounter, they eventually reach a place. And when they do, the local people have a choice to make: to help those who arrive at their border or to ignore and not help those who arrive at their border. I suggest that you help those who arrive at your border. The local people of Malta did not expect that there would be a ship of people arriving at their sea border. And yet, they took them in and showed them extraordinary kindness and generosity even though they were prisoners and Apostle Paul was thought to be a murderer. Likewise, you may think that the migrants that journey to your border are murderers or other people that you deem unseemly. Yet, irregardless or your thoughts on those who come to your border, I reckon that you should to follow the example that the local people of Malta set by welcoming them into your home (country). In that way you may help them get back on track in their journey in their life. God has great plans for them. God has plans to use them mightily for His kingdom, just like Apostle Paul. They just need some help. Will you help them to get back on track in their journey in life? God bless.","summary":"There are many whom God plans to use mightily.

        "content_text":"Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand. And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come here.” And he said to them, “Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. Mark 3:1–5 RSV As it was mentioned in the previous message, there is a law that states that no one is to work on the Sabbath because it was designated by God as a day of rest. However, Jesus Himself did not observe the Sabbath; instead, He did things that are considered work, such as teaching and healing people. For example, as mentioned in the Scripture above, Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day to teach the people who were there. One such person was a man with a withered hand. Scribes and Pharisees—those considered the elites of that day and age—were also there to see if He would do work (healing people) on that Sabbath day, so that they may have reason to accuse Him of breaking that law. He did. Jesus told the man with the withered hand to step forward and stretch out his hand. When the man did as Jesus said to do, his hand was restored to wholeness. Now, Jesus justified what He did by asking the people who were there a rhetorical question: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” In essence, Jesus was saying that the doing of nothing, in order to strictly adhere to the law, may, in fact, result in the doing of something: the harming and the killing of life. And because the scribes and Pharisees subscribe to the idea of strict adherence to the law, they, and those who try to practice the scribes and Pharisees’ interpretation of how to adhere to the law, may incidentally be preventing themselves from fulfilling the law; for, it is written, the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Galatians 5:14 ESV) since love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:10 NIV). Now, this may not be too different from what happens in this day and age. For example, most if not all countries have laws that regulate who may enter their borders. And sometimes people migrate to a country to seek asylum since they are hated and persecuted and fear for their safety in their home country of residence. When they do that, they may be put in a detention centre whilst going through the asylum process in accordance with the laws of the country that they chose to migrate to. Though the people of that country may just be strictly enforcing its laws, this strict adherence to the law may result in the harming or killing of life. And if the applications of the asylum seekers are not granted, they may be deported back to their home country of residence where they too may face the harming or killing of (their) life. But that ought not to be! For this strict adherence to the law may, in actuality, restrict you from also showing love to your neighbours who have come to the doorstep (border) of your home (country) seeking your help. Now, you may be wondering who your neighbour is. A certain expert in the law also wondered such a thing. And so, he asked Jesus. Jesus responded in the form of a parable—the Parable of the Good Samaritan. In this parable, Jesus speaks of a certain man travelling down from Jerusalem to Jericho. On the way, he fell among thieves who attacked him, stripped him, beat him, and then fled, leaving him half dead on the side of the road. There were three people who came across the certain man: a certain priest, a Levite, and a certain Samaritan. When the certain priest came down the road and saw the certain man, he passed by the other side. The Levite did likewise. When the certain Samaritan, on the other hand, saw the certain man who fell among thieves, he dressed his wounds, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The certain priest and Levite did nothing to help that man, even though they should have known to do something. If the certain Samaritan did not encounter the certain man and do something to help him, then he would have certainly died from his wounds. Thus, the certain man only survived because the Samaritan did something when he saw him. Thus, in broader terms, it could be said that doing nothing, even though you know that you should do something, may result in the harming and killing of life while the doing of the something that you know that you should do, instead of doing nothing, may result in good and the saving of life. As mentioned in a previous story, one’s life is not the only thing that may experience death. Likewise, one’s life is not the only thing that could be wounded. Any aspect of one’s life may be wounded. And any aspect of one’s life may experience death because of their wounds. Like those who came across the certain man who fell among thieves, you too may come across a person who has some aspect of their life that is wounded and half dead. For example, you may come across a person on the streets who is asking for some money since they have a wounded financial situation. Or you may encounter friends whose relationships are wounded or half dead. You may encounter an acquaintance who is in need of encouragement and strengthening since their confidence was wounded. Or you may come across a family member who is in need of some comfort because their heart has been wounded. Yes, in your day to day life, you may encounter a multitude of people, whom you may or may not know, with some aspect of their life wounded or half dead. And when you do encounter such a person, you have a decision to make: to do nothing like the certain priest and Levite, or to do something like the certain Samaritan. If I may, may I suggest that you do something because the doing of nothing may result in the harming or the death (not necessarily of their life but of some aspect of their life) of that person in need of help while the doing of something may result in good and the saving of life (or the aspect of their life that is wounded and half dead). Now, we are all like that certain man. The certain man who fell among thieves was on a journey from one place to the other. In fact, the certain priest, Levite, and certain Samaritan were also on a journey from one place to another. And like the certain man, certain priest, Levite, and certain Samaritan, we too are on a journey in this life of ours. And like the certain man, we have all been felled by the thief. (The thief may represent the devil. And as is mentioned in John 10:10, the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.) And like the certain priest and Levite and certain Samaritan, we have all come across people who has been felled by the thief. When we are felled by the thief, how would you like other people to respond when they come across us? Would you like them to ignore you and avoid you, in a similar manner to how the certain priest and Levite ignored and avoided the certain man when they came across him? Or would you like them to help you, address your wounds, and take care of you? If I may, may I recommend that you respond similarly to how the Samaritan responded when he encountered the certain man who fell among thieves. For it is only through such a response that good and the saving of life may result. On the other hand, following the response of the certain priest and Levite results in death. The certain priest and Levite did not help the certain man because helping him would have made them ceremonially unclean according to the law. And, as mentioned earlier, this strict adherence to the law may result in the harming and killing of life. For, their actions (avoiding the certain man) in order to strictly adhere to the law results in their inaction (the doing of nothing to help the certain man), which surely would have resulted in the death of the certain man if the certain Samaritan did not eventually come across him. Stopping and taking the time to help him would have also delayed them from where they were going. In other words, helping him would have inconvenienced them. For similar reasons, we too may decide not to help a person in need. We too may decide to not stop to help a person in need because we do not want to be delayed in arriving at our destination. And we may also decide to not help a person in need because it is too burdensome or inconvenient to do such a thing in terms of effort and cost among other factors. Or we may think that someone else will eventually come along to help that person. But that ought not to be! Instead, like the Samaritan, we should take the time out of our lives to help those in need. Likewise, we ought not put consideration of our own lives ahead of the consideration of the lives of those who are in need. Therefore, when you encounter any person who is in need of some help, may I recommend for you do as Jesus said to man who had a withered hand to do: “Stretch out your hand.” I suggest you stretch out a (helping) hand to those who are in need so that good and the saving of life may result rather than harm and the killing of life. This is especially true for those who believe in Jesus. For, as mentioned in previous stories, those who have not put their faith in Jesus are subjected to death since all have sinned and are therefore guilty according to the law of sin and death. And so, if you decide to do nothing to share the word of God to those who do not believe, then it shall surely result in their death. If, however, you do something to share the word of God to those who have never believed as well as encourage those who used to believe but have fallen by the wayside, then it may result in good and the saving of life if they decide to believe in Jesus. As it was mentioned, those who believe in Jesus are justified by faith. Thus, those who believe shall be found innocent according to the law of sin and death and therefore not pay the penalty of that law—death. Instead, they shall fulfill the original intent that God has for each and every one of us: eternal life. As such, it is imperative for those who do believe in Jesus to also stretch out their hand and reach out to those who do not yet believe in Jesus so that the saving of life may result. However, do not stretch out your hand just to fulfill their spiritual needs by sharing the word of God. You should also fulfill their physical needs. Therefore, in this new year, let us resolve to love your neighbour by stretching out a (helping) hand to every person that we encounter who is in need so that we may do good and save life. Happy New Year and God bless.","summary":"The doing of nothing may result in the harming and killing of life while the doing of something may result in good and the saving of life.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/52389587-235d7600-2a62-11e9-8e0c-981506a52a89.jpg","date_published": "2019-01-02T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross! Philippians 2:6–8 NIV In the previous story it was mentioned that we sin when we do things that do not come from faith. And since we have all sinned, we are all guilty according to the law of sin and death. However, God did not destine us to wrath (pay the penalty of that law—death); instead, we were always destined for eternal life. Now, for God’s destiny for us to come to pass, we needed to be justified so that we may be found innocent according to the law. And this justification can only come through faith in Jesus Christ. It does not come through obedience of the law that God gave through angels to Moses for the people of Israel (and is also written in our hearts) because that is not the purpose of that law. And this is also evident in the story of Jesus’ appearance as a man in human form. Mentioned in the Scripture above, when Jesus appeared as a man in human form, He was obedient, even to the point of death on a cross. Now, this obedience is not referring to His obedience to the law that God gave to the people of Israel to follow. Rather, this obedience is referring to His obedience to God the Father in Heaven. While He was a man in human form, Jesus was always obedient to God the Father in Heaven. And Jesus was always obedient to God the Father in Heaven since He always had faith in Him; He never doubted Him. And since Jesus’ actions were always done from faith, He never sinned against His Father in Heaven. In other words, Jesus did what Adam and Eve (and the rest of us) were unable to do. Since He always had faith in His God the Father in Heaven, He was justified in the sight of God. And as it is written in the Scriptures: For this reason God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow—of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth—and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:9–11 HCSB). Now, if this obedience of His were referring to obedience of the law that God gave for the people of Israel, then His justification in the eyes of His God the Father in Heaven would have been based on works (obeying the law) instead of faith. And if that were the case, then Jesus would be showing that it is possible for a person to be justified through works, instead of only by faith. But that is not the case! For, not even Jesus followed all of the statutes of the law. According to the law that God gave Moses: Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns (Exodus 20:9–10 NIV). And yet, on many occasions Jesus did not rest on the Sabbath; instead, He did things that are considered work (such as heal people). Though He did not always follow the statutes of the law, Jesus did always follow His Father in Heaven. And because of this, He was justified and without sin. Now, showing that even He was justified by faith and not by works is not the only reason that He appeared as a man in human form; He also came to learn obedience. In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. Hebrews 5:7–8 ESV Although Jesus always did what His Father in Heaven told Him to do by faith, it does not mean that He always wanted to do what His Father in Heaven told Him to do. In fact, Jesus sometimes offered up prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears because there were times when He preferred not to do the thing that His Father in Heaven wanted Him to do. For example, it was mentioned in a previous story that, after Jesus was arrested, two came forward and made allegations against Him by misconstruing the words that He spoke in order to find a reason to sentence Him to death. However, before Jesus was arrested, He was offering up prayers and supplications to His Father in Heaven. He prayed, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will” (Mark 14:36 NKJV). Jesus prayed that He would not have to go through with what His Father in Heaven planned for Him, yet He did not disobey His Father in Heaven. Jesus instead did that which He pleaded not to do because He had complete faith in His Father in Heaven and trusted that He knew that which is best for Him. This obedience of His was learned through the challenging situations that He went through whilst appearing as a man in human form. Think about that. As mentioned in the first Scripture quoted at the top of this story, Jesus is God. That is His very nature. Not human. God. As God, He has authority over everything. Nothing is above Him; instead, everything is under Him. And as God, He is king and ruler over everything. As such, He is subject to no one; instead, all are subject to Him. And because of the position that He holds, He has never had to obey anyone else before; rather, all have had to obey Him. And then He made the choice to leave His position of authority to make Himself nothing by taking on the very nature of a servant when He appeared as a man in the form of a human. He went from being, in nature, God to being, in nature, a servant. All of a sudden, He was no longer a king or a ruler; He was a servant. As a servant, He had to learn obedience as a man in the form of a human. And through this obedience that He learned, He was made perfect (justified in the sight of His Father in Heaven). And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek (Hebrews 5:9–10 ESV). Now, God the Father in Heaven may also tell you to do something that you, for some reason, prefer not to do. And when that happens, you may do as Jesus did and offer up prayers and supplications through loud cries and tears in hopes of persuading God the Father in Heaven of freeing you from the something that He asked you to do. (This is not to imply that you are bound or imprisoned by what He asks you to do. You, of course, have freedom to decide whether or not do what He asks.) And when you do that, God the Father in Heaven may decline to rescind what He asked you to do, similarly to how God the Father in Heaven did not rescind what He asked of Jesus when He offered up prayers and supplications to Him. (Now, as it was mentioned in a previous story, while you may not understand why He asked you to do something, there may be a reason for it: so that the plans that He has for your life may be fulfilled.) Instead of rescinding what He asked Jesus to do, God the Father in Heaven sent an angel from heaven to appear by His side and strengthen Him so that He may have the resolve to continue on and go forward and do what was asked of Him. Likewise, your God the Father in Heaven might also provide you with comfort, encouragement, and strength so that you may go through with what He asked of you. And when that occurs, you have a decision to make: to obey God the Father in Heaven and the things that He wants you to do, or to disobey Him and not do what God the Father in Heaven wants you to do. And now, if I may, may I suggest for you to follow the example that Jesus set by obeying your Father in Heaven and doing the things that He asked of you. While you may not understand why He asked you to do such a thing, just trust in Him and believe that He knows what is best for your life. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. Hebrews 2:17–18 ESV For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are — yet he did not sin. Hebrews 4:15 NIV Now, learning obedience through what He experienced is not the only reason that Jesus appeared as a man in human form. He also had to be made like His brothers and sisters (human) in every respect so that He can experience being tempted in every way. Being tempted is being allured into the doing something that you should not do because of its seemingly desirable consequence. As mentioned in a previous story, the serpent tempted Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil by outlining the seemingly desirable consequences of eating from that tree. Jesus was also tempted in every which way, just as we are. Through these experiences, He gained understanding of the temptations that we face as well as empathy towards us who may succumb to them. Since Jesus has experienced the temptations that we face, however did not succumb to them, He may also help us to refrain from that which tempts us. For, if Jesus did not have any experience with temptation, then He would also not understand the temptations that we face. And if Jesus did not understand the temptations that we face, then He would also not be able to empathize with us. Now, this may not be too different from any other person. Not everyone have experienced the situations that you have experienced. And if a person has not experienced what you have experienced, then they may not understand the allure of that which tempts you. And since they do not understand the allure of that which tempts you, then they may not be able to empathize with your situation or know how to help. Rather than empathizing with you, those who do not understand why you (or anyone) would succumb to the allures of that which tempts them may instead look down upon you and ignore you and abandon you and condemn you for your lack of strength and ability to refrain from succumbing to that which tempts you. For example, some people may have experience with the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, the loss of one’s health, and the stresses that come with being in a precarious financial situation. And because of those life experiences, they may succumb to certain temptations that allure them. Now, those without such experiences may not be able to understand those who are currently in the midst of those types of experiences. And because they do not understand the things that you are going through, they may not be able to empathize with you nor know how to help you, comfort you, or strengthen you so that you could get through your situation. Instead of empathizing with you, those who do not understand what you are going through for lack of similar experience may instead look down upon you or ignore you or abandon you, or even condemn you for your lack of strength to refrain from that which tempts you and inability to get through your situation you may be in the midst of. However, Jesus is not like those people since He experienced much suffering and temptations whilst appearing as a man in human form. Thus, you are not alone in your experiences. Jesus is always with you. Unlike all His disciples who deserted Him when He was arrested in a garden called Gethsemane, He shall faithfully stay by your side, for He knows what it is like to be deserted by others. Likewise, He shall not condemn you or look down upon you because of the situation that you are in; rather, He will show you mercy and empathy, for He knows and understands the situation that you are in since He Himself has experienced condemnation and a lack of mercy at the hands of the people who arrested Him. And because of His personal experience, Jesus may also provide comfort, support, and strength for you to overcome the challenging situations that you are experiencing. Just believe. One more thing. If Jesus did not experience all the things that we experience in life, then He may be considered like those who are labeled the elite—those who are out of touch with the reality of most people because they do not have experience or understanding of the challenges that most of us face on a daily basis—by the people of this day and age. And because of this, the elite are also thought of as those who only have their own best interests at heart and therefore do the things that they do out of personal ambition or self-centered reasons and with no regard for the ill effects that it may cause to those who are not considered a part of the elite. As such, those who are labeled the elites may be considered people who only care about themselves whilst having no cares or thoughts for those who are not considered the elite. Therefore, Jesus had to experience all the things that we experience in life so that He may not be considered as being elite or out of touch with the reality of the people of this world. Likewise, Jesus also came to show us that He is not like the elite who marginalize others while elevating themselves; rather, Jesus stood up for those who are marginalized by the people who are considered the elite. And this is evident in the Gospels. The scribes and Pharisees were viewed as the elite in those times. Those elites looked down upon the others, such as sinners and tax collectors, swindlers and adulterers, those who are sick and those who are demon-possessed, and the like; and yet, Jesus always stood up for them. Jesus never looked down upon them. Jesus never condemned them. Instead, Jesus had compassion for them. And Jesus provided help in their time of need. And I suggest that you do likewise. Whilst you may not be able to have the same experiences that others have had in order to understand their current situation in life and show them empathy like Jesus did, what you may do is refrain from looking down upon them and condemning those whom you do not really know. Likewise, may I also suggest that you do things with other people’s best interest at heart instead of your own lest others experience ill effects due to your actions. In this way, you may follow the example that Jesus set, as He had our best interests at heart when He took up the cross and died for us so that those who believe in Him may receive eternal life. God bless.","summary":"Jesus had to be made like us (human) to understand the challenges we experience and empathize with our weaknesses whilst amidst challenges.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/52190615-19dbd000-280e-11e9-9fd5-2cbdfa92ed97.jpg","date_published": "2018-12-26T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? Romans 10:13–14 NLT In the previous stories it was recommended that you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God. This suggestion also outlined some of the benefits that you may gain from cultivating a relationship with Him, such as being forewarned when certain actions shall certainly result in death as well as receiving help whilst amidst the challenges that you may experience. Of course, to cultivate a relationship with the Lord God, you must first believe in Him. And for you to believe in Him, you must first hear about Him. And, as mentioned in a previous story, you might hear about Him through a source—such as a preacher or family member or friend or blog that you may discover while perusing the Internet. Now, this may not be different from the relationships that you have with others. If you have not heard of a person, then you would not know of that person’s existence. And if you do not know of that person’s existence, then you cannot cultivate a relationship with that person. Now, the serpent does not want you to believe in the word of God that you heard lest you believe in Him and be saved. You may be wondering what you are being saved from. And you may also be wondering about why you need to be saved as you may not even think that you are in peril. You may also be wondering why calling on the name of the Lord because you believe in Him results in you being saved. Thus, this story shall try to answer those considerations of yours so that you may understand the reasons why each and every one of us needs to believe in Him and call on the name of the Lord to be saved. And now, to answer those considerations of yours, it is inevitable that I broach the subject of sin, so bear with me in this matter. But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin. Romans 14:23 NIV But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning. Romans 14:23 NLT As it was mentioned in a previous story, Adam and Eve never ate from the tree of life because death was not a concern for them until they chose to eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Before those two decided to do such a thing, they never had a reason to eat from the tree of life because death did not exist. In other words, if not for this decision that they made, those two would still be alive in this day and age. (Of course, this is presuming that none of their descendants decide to eat from that tree as well in the course of time.) In essence, the Lord God’s original intent when He created Adam and Eve was for them to live for eternity. The Lord God did not create Adam and Eve just so they would eventually die. Not at all! The Lord God created Adam and Eve, man and woman, with eternal life in mind. The Lord God’s original intent for Adam and Eve is also His intent for all of us. Eternal life is the Lord God’s intent for all of us. (I reckon this intent also extended to all of the beast of the earth as well as all of the birds of the air and creatures that move on the ground since the Lord God only gave them every green herb for food when He created them. And so, those creatures would not have killed each other to eat as food; instead, all of the creatures were vegan. I reckon that the Lord God’s original intent was for each man, woman, and living creature—beast of the earth, cattle, those that move along the ground, those that abound in the water, as well as birds of the air—to live harmoniously together. Of course, as you may be able to tell through perusing the daily news headlines or your social media feeds, such an intent is certainly not being realized in this day and age.) For, the Lord God’s original intent for Adam and Eve (and the rest of us) was derailed when they made the choice to eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now, as mentioned in a previous story, this decision to eat from that tree was contrary to what the Lord God told them to do. The Lord God told Adam and Eve: “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” They made the decision to eat from that tree because they did not believe in what the Lord God said to them; they instead believed what the serpent said to them. Because of their lack of belief in what the Lord God said to them, they disobeyed Him. In other words, they sinned against the Lord God. Sin is doing some action that does not come from faith. Sin is doing some action even though you lack conviction on whether or not you should do that action. (It is, of course, not limited to eating; it is just an example used by the Scriptures above.) And through this sin of theirs came the ironic birth of death. Death was birthed through this sin of theirs because the Lord God explicitly told them that they shall certainly die when they eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As mentioned in the previous stories, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God, you may get to know His character along with His voice. Well, one of the characteristics of the Lord God that you may discover is that He cannot lie. Therefore, when Adam and Eve chose to disobey (sin against) the Lord God, death had to be birthed. If death did not birth because of their actions, that would make the Lord God into a liar. It is just unfortunate that the death that was birthed was not limited to just those two. Instead, the death that was birthed spread to all of us like an infectious disease. Since Adam and Eve’s decision, sin and its resulting consequence (death) has been a governing force of nature. It is, in essence, like gravity, one of the other governing forces of nature. According to this law, gravity is a force that acts between two objects causing them to be attracted to each other. That is why, when you throw an object up, it shall eventually come back down. This is because the gravity of the earth attracts the thrown object back toward it. In the law of sin and death, those who sin shall eventually die. As mentioned in a previous story, all of us have sinned, thus all of us shall eventually die. Also mentioned in a previous story: life is not the only thing that may be considered dead. Thus, the death that is mentioned here is not just referring to the death of your life. It is also referring to the death of your innocence (according to the law of sin and death) in the eyes of God. Like the law of gravity, the law of sin and death is a governing force of nature that is still in effect in this day and age. Although this law came into existence, the Lord God still desires for His original intent for each and every one of us to come to pass. The Lord God still desires for each and every one of us to have eternal life. And for this desire of His to come to fruition, we need to be justified in the eyes of God so that we may be found innocent according to the law of sin and death, and thereby not face the consequence of that law (death). Now, to understand how God accomplishes such a thing, we shall now be taking a little dip into the history of the people of Israel. Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people. Galatians 3:19 NLT As it is mentioned in the Scriptures above, God gave His law through angels to Moses. This law is not referring to the law of sin and death that was broached earlier. The law mentioned in the Scriptures above includes: the commandments, various laws as well as the punishments that shall be applied to those who transgress those laws, the establishment of various holidays, sacrifices, and offerings that are to be observed, description of the roles and responsibilities of officials, and the construction of various structures where those officials would be serving. This may be similar to those who may rule over others, such as a president or prime minister of a country. The prime minister of a country may enact a law and a corresponding punishment that shall be applied to those who transgress that law. For example, a law may be enacted to fine those who speed or litter. And a president might establish new holidays, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, that the citizens of the country may observe. The ruler of a country might also describe the roles and responsibilities of the officials serving under the ruler’s administration as well as the location where they are to serve in their roles. For example, the ruler of a nation may appoint different people to the role of vice president and chief of staff and the head of a department or ministry, with each role serving out of offices that are located in a different place. Now, God did not give the law through Moses because He is an authoritarian who desires to limit the freedoms of the people of Israel by regulating every aspect of their life. Not at all! As it was mentioned in a previous story, each and every one of us has free will and the freedom to make our own decisions. Instead, God gave the law to the people of Israel in order to show them that they are all with sin by bringing to light all of their sins. Through the law came knowledge of sin. If the people of Israel had not known that which is sin, then they would also not have known that they sinned. This may not be too different from other countries that enact laws for its citizens and residents to follow. For example, if you do not know the laws of the nation that you are currently in (maybe because you are just there on vacation), then you would also not know whether or not you are breaking the laws of that country unless you are told by someone (or are arrested). However, if you know the laws of a nation (maybe because you are a citizen or resident), then you may also know whether or not doing something goes against one of those laws. Thus, with knowledge of laws come knowledge of when you are disobeying those laws. You may be wondering what any of this has to do with you. You may also think that the law that God gave to the people of Israel through Moses is from a different time period, therefore it is not relevant to you in this day and age. And you may also think that these laws do not apply to you because they were given to a people who are citizens of a nation that is different from the country that you are a citizen or resident of. Rather, you may think that only the rules and regulations of the countries that you are a citizen and resident of apply to you. As an example, you might observe the holidays of the country in which you hold citizenship and residency. However, you might not observe holidays that are exclusive to the countries that you are not a citizen or resident of. Likewise, a country may enact laws which limit the speed that vehicles may travel. However, you may currently be living in a nation without laws that limit the speed of vehicles on their motorways. If that is the case, you can travel on motorways at speeds that are limited by only the current road and traffic conditions as well as your moxie (or, as some might say, recklessness). And when you do that, you will not be transgressing the speed limit law of the other country because you are not a current resident of that country. As such, the country with the speed limit law cannot penalize you because you are not a current resident of that country, thus their laws do not apply to you. Therefore, because the law that God gave to the people of Israel is not applicable to you, you may think that you cannot transgress those laws. And since you cannot transgress laws that are not applicable to you, you may also think that you cannot be judged guilty of transgressing those laws. (I am using a human argument here.) And if you can make such a case, then you may be viewed as a Gentile. Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it. They demonstrate that God’s law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right. Romans 2:14–15 NLT The law is written in your hearts. And you demonstrate your knowledge of God’s written law when you instinctively obey it, even without having heard it, for your own thoughts and conscience tells you whether or not you are doing that which is right or wrong. In other words, each and every one of us has a set of morals that are written in our hearts. From these morals that are written in our hearts, we may conscientiously determine whether something is right or wrong. For example, in a previous story it was mentioned that a person may decide to bring to light the actions or words of someone by publicly sharing those actions or words on the social media platform of their choice to multitudes of peoples who do not know that someone. And when that happens, the multitudes who hear about the actions or words of that someone might decide to judge that person guilty and mete out the punishment that they have sentenced that someone to. While the previous story did not recommend for you to judge and sentence the someone for the actions or words that were brought to light by a person, the judgement that was rendered by the multitude of people who heard about the actions or words of that someone may have been based on their view of what is right or wrong. And this view may be based on God’s law that is written in their heart. Rather, the previous story recommends that you direct your gaze inwards and evaluate yourself and see if you are with or without sin. And when you do that you shall be convicted by your conscience as it brings to light the sins that you are with. For, all are with sin. Not one is without sin. And because we are all with sin, we all are also subject to the consequence of sin (death). You may be wondering why a person would not be considered innocent in God’s sight if a person were to always obey the law. I tell you the truth: it is not the purpose of the law to justify a person in God’s sight. As mentioned, the purpose of the law is to make a person become conscious of sin. The law is not meant to perform a function that it was not designed to do in a similar fashion to how a printer is not meant to brew coffee. No! The function of a printer is to print and nothing more since that is the purpose for which it was designed for. And so, obedience of the law does not justify you in God’s sight because that is not the purpose of the law. And since obedience of the law does not justify you in God’s sight, there had to be something that was designed for the purpose of justifying you in the sight of God so that you may be found innocent according to the law, and thereby not face the consequence (death). And that something is faith in Jesus Christ. This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. Romans 3:22–24 NIV Therefore there is now no condemnation [no guilty verdict, no punishment] for those who are in Christ Jesus [who believe in Him as personal Lord and Savior]. For the law of the Spirit of life [which is] in Christ Jesus [the law of our new being] has set you free from the law of sin and of death. Romans 8:1–2 AMP Faith in Jesus Christ justifies all of us in the eyes of the God. And because this faith justifies us in His sight, we are freed from the consequence of the law of sin and death. And since those who believe are freed from the consequence of the law of sin and death, the original intent that the Lord God has for each and every one of us—eternal life—may be realized by all who believe in Him. As a matter of fact, faith has always been the Lord God’s method to accomplish His desire for each and every one of us to have eternal life. We can see this in the story of Adam and Eve that was mentioned near the beginning. If Adam and Eve had made the decision to believe in the Lord God instead of the serpent (and continued to believe in the Lord God over the serpent in subsequent matters), then those two would surely still be alive in this day and age. In other words, if Adam and Eve never doubt the Lord God in any matter, then those two would surely still be alive in this day and age. (Now, of course this is again presuming that none of their descendants birth death by sinning against the Lord God.) In essence, eternal life through faith in the Lord God has always been His intent. And this intent of the Lord God’s is not just for Adam and Eve; it is, in fact, for each and every one of us. For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him (1 Thessalonians 5:9–10 NASB). We were always destined to obtain salvation through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ rather than face the consequence of the law of sin and death. And that is evident in the story of Adam and Eve. Now, you may have noticed that those who put their faith in Jesus Christ still experience death in a like fashion to those who do not believe in Jesus Christ. This is true. However, the death of those who believe is temporary; it is not permanent. Regardless of whether or not those who place their faith in Jesus Christ are awake (still alive) or asleep (have died) when He returns, they shall all live together with Him. And at that time, the life of those who put their faith in Jesus Christ shall be permanent; it shall not be temporary. Therefore, this Christmas, in addition to receiving and accepting gifts from your friends and family and significant other, may I make the recommendation that you accept the free gift of life that you shall receive when you believe and call on the name of the Lord: Jesus. Merry Christmas and God bless.","summary":"Eternal life is the Lord God's intent for all of us. His intent was derailed when death was birthed.

        "title":"Parable Of The Sower",
        "content_text":"His disciples asked him what this parable meant. He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’” Luke 8:9–10 NIV Parables, in this day and age, may be viewed as encrypted messages. Although they are encrypted, the messages are not private or inaccessible. Rather, the encrypted messages are publicly available. Anyone can access the encrypted messages in the Scriptures and read them. And anyone may share the encrypted messages to others. Jesus Himself shared many parables to multitudes who gathered to hear Him. Though public, not everyone has the decryption key needed to decipher the encrypted messages. Without the decryption key, they can see the message, but only in encrypted form. In this form, however, the encrypted messages are meaningless to readers. This is why Jesus said, “although seeing, they may not see; although hearing, they may not understand.” Messages that are encrypted with a well-designed encryption scheme may not be deciphered without the decryption key. That is why those without the decryption key may see and hear the message, however what they see is in an encrypted form so they do not understand the message; rather it is without meaning to them. Only those with the decryption key may understand the message. And the decryption key is held by the One who encrypted the message. In this case, Jesus. Now, Jesus has not kept the decryption key to Himself. Instead, He shared the decryption key to His disciples so that they may know the secrets of the kingdom of God. And with this decryption key, the parable of the sower was deciphered so that His disciples may understand the underlying message of that parable that He shared to them while the great multitude of others who had gathered and also heard Jesus share the parable of the sower were left without understanding of its deeper meaning. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. Luke 8:11–12 NKJV As mentioned in the previous story, you may cultivate a relationship with the Lord God by regularly praying to and communing with Him. And through this relationship that you cultivate with Him, the Lord God may respond to your prayers and communications with Him. The Lord God may also give you some foresight into what is to come in your life as well as some advice on what to do or not to do so that life rather than death befalls any aspect of your life. And when this happens, the serpent (devil) might spring into action and use one of the tactics in his toolbox. The serpent may try to get you to doubt in your heart that the Lord God said what you think He said by getting you think that you are mistaken to think that it really was the Lord God’s voice that you heard. And if the serpent is successful in employing this tactic against you, then you may be like the ones by the wayside who hear the word of God but has it taken out of their hearts by the devil so that you do not believe that you really heard the Lord God speaking to you. As mentioned here as well as in the previous story, the serpent does this because he fears us believing and being saved if we were to believe that we really heard the voice of the Lord God. And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away. Luke 8:13 ESV As it was mentioned in the previous story, if the serpent is not successful in his attempts at getting you to doubt in your heart that the Lord God said what you think He said, then the serpent may try to employ another one of his tactics in his toolbox. The serpent may try to get you to doubt in your heart the veracity of what you believe the Lord God said. For example, the Lord God may inform you that doing something will certainly result in the death of a friendship. You may initially believe what the Lord God said to you. Then, the serpent may spring into action and use one of his tactics to get you to doubt the veracity of what the Lord God said to you. If the serpent succeeds in employing this tactic against you, then you may be like those on the rocks who hear the word of God and receive it with joy. They believe for a while but then stop believing in the word of God that they heard because the serpent was successful in getting them to doubt the veracity of what the Lord God said. And as is mentioned in the last story, the serpent does this so that you fall away from the Lord God as well as lose faith in Him and what He says to you. As for what fell among the thorns, these are the ones who hear; but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. Luke 8:14 NRSV As it was mentioned in the previous story, the serpent may also try to get you to pursue things which seems desirable and beneficial from your standpoint, instead of following the plan that the Lord God has for you. The serpent may try to do this by outlining all the benefits of pursuing that which seems desirable whilst minimizing all the consequences. For example, the Lord God may tell you to not buy that house in that neighbourhood. When the Lord God does that, the serpent may spring into action and attempt to get you to do what the Lord God said not to by outlining all the seemingly desirable and beneficial qualities of buying that house, such as, perhaps, its price, the neighbourhood that it is located in, and its closeness to your workplace. If the serpent is successful in using this tactic against you, then you may be like those who fell among the thorns: those who hear the word of God but do not follow the advice that the Lord God gave them. Instead, they follow their own desires and plans in life. And in the process of time, they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life. They do not grow or mature, nor do they bear fruit that may nourish (bless) others. And as is mentioned in the previous story, the serpent does this so that you do not follow or fulfill the Lord God’s plans for your life. By the wayside. On the rock. Among the thorns. Besides being a description of those who fell victim to the tricks of the serpent, the parable of the sower also describes the different stages that each and every one of us progresses through in their walk of faith in the Lord God. Every one of us start by the wayside. You may currently be by the wayside as well. If that is so, that is great. Every one of us was by the wayside at some point. Many still are. Like those who are currently by the wayside, you might have initially heard the word of God through a source—such as a preacher, family member, friend, or blog that you came across while surfing on the Internet. If this is the case, then may I encourage you to continue to hear the word of God through your source because that source may help explain the word of God to you, similarly to how Jesus explained the meaning of the parable of the sower to His disciples. And I hope that you eventually make the personal decision to believe in the word of God that was shared to you and profess your faith in Jesus so that you shall be saved. However, as it was mentioned above, the serpent does not want you to believe in the word of God you heard lest you be saved. And so, like a thief, the serpent tries to take the word of God that you heard out of your heart. If successful, the word of God that you heard is discarded, ignored, rejected or set aside. In essence, the word of God falls by the wayside. You may have heard that idiom before. This may be where it came from. If you do choose to believe in the Lord God because of the word of God that was shared to you by your source, then congratulations, for you have now progressed to the next stage in your walk of faith in the Lord God: on the rocks. And when you do that, I hope that it is not the end of your walk of faith. Instead, I hope that it is the beginning of a relationship that you build with the Lord God. Once you get to this step in your walk of faith in the Lord God, you will receive the word of God with joy and faith. However, after a while, you stop believing in the word of God as well as lose faith in the Lord God due to the challenging situations that you experience. In other words, the relationship that you started to build with the Lord God is on the rocks—experiencing difficulties or storms that may cause the relationship to end. You may have heard of that idiom before. I reckon that this is where it originated from. Of course, as you may know, each and every one of us may go through challenging situations that may test a relationship. You may go through a challenging situation that tests your relationship with your friends or family. And you may also experience challenging situations that test your relationship with a significant other. Now, the relationship that you decided to cultivate with the Lord God is no different. It too shall be tested during the challenging situations that you go through. And during these challenging situations that you may go through, I hope that you conclude that the relationship that you are cultivating with the Lord God is worth continuing, rather than ending it. As is mentioned in previous stories, Jesus experienced challenging situations. As did Joseph. Yet, despite the challenging situations that they experienced, both of them decided to continue the relationship they cultivated with the Lord God because both of them found their relationship with the Lord God worthy to be continued. I hope that you do as well. And as it was mentioned in previous stories, the Lord God is with you during those challenging situations; He may help you get through them since He understands what you are going through. And so, endure, for relationships that survive the trying times strengthen the bond between those in the relationship. It may also increase the love between those in the relationship. And with this strengthened bond and increased love between you and the Lord God, you may learn to trust in Him because He has your best interests at heart and knows what is best for you. However, if your relationship with the Lord God does end because of the challenging situations that you experienced, then your faith in Him may fall by the wayside and you may regress to the previous stage. On the other hand, if your relationship with the Lord God survives those trying times that you have experienced, you may progress to the next stage in your walk of faith in the Lord God: among the thorns. Unlike by the wayside or on the rocks, as far as I know, among the thorns is not an idiom. Irregardless, in this stage of your walk of faith in the Lord God, you hear and believe in the word of God, however, you do not grow or mature nor bear fruit because you are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life. Now, just to be clear so that you do not get the wrong impression: there is nothing inherently amiss about cares, riches, and pleasures of life. Nor is there anything inherently amiss about desiring cares or riches or pleasures of life. It is only considered amiss if you put your desire and love of cares, riches and pleasures of life ahead of your desire and love of the Lord God. For example, cares in and of itself are not inherently amiss. There is nothing inherently amiss about caring and having passion for your job or business or hobby. This is only amiss if your cares and passion for them exceed your cares and passion for the Lord God. Likewise, riches or money is not inherently amiss because money may be used for a multitude of wonderful things. For example, money may be used to purchase food to feed you and your family. And money may be used to buy a house for your family. Money may be used to buy necessities. And money may be used to help others. So there is nothing inherently amiss with money in and of itself. It is only amiss when you place your desire for and love of money ahead of your desire for and love of the Lord God. And likewise, the pleasures of life in and of itself are not inherently amiss. For example, there is nothing inherently amiss about experiential things like a good movie or vacation or restaurant. Nor is it inherently amiss to desire material things like cars, clothing, and collectibles. These experiential and material things are only considered amiss if they are desired and loved by you more than you desire and love the Lord God. In essence, the things of life (cares, riches, and pleasures) are only amiss if those things inform your life and life choices rather than the Lord God. And the things of life are only amiss if you desire, love and pursue them ahead of loving, desiring and pursuing the Lord God. This may not be too different from other relationships that you may have. For example, you may have a relationship with a significant other. And if you decide to put other things and people ahead of your significant other whilst your significant other puts you ahead of other things and people, your significant other may think that something is amiss. Your significant other may think that you are taking advantage of them. Your significant other might also think that you do not care or love or desire them as much as the other things and people that you are focused on. And your significant other may also feel like the love that they have for you is an unrequited love. And because of this, your relationship with your significant other does not grow deeper, nor does it mature and bear fruit. And when such a thing happens, your relationship with your significant other may regress from among the thorns and back to on the rocks. Now, such a thing may also happen to your relationship with the Lord God if you were to focus on other things and people ahead Him. It could seem like you are taking advantage of the Lord God. And it may seem like the Lord God’s love for you is unrequited. Thus, I suggest that you love and desire the Lord God ahead of all else. In this way you may progress to the next stage in your walk of faith in the Lord God: in the good ground. But the seed in the good ground—these are the ones who, having heard the word with an honest and good heart, hold on to it and by enduring, bear fruit. Luke 8:15 HCSB Now, those who are in the good ground hears the word of God with an honest and good heart. And having heard the word of God, they hold onto it and bear fruit by enduring. Now, although you have reached this stage in your walk of faith in the Lord God, it does not mean the serpent stops trying to employ his tactics against you. It is, in fact, quite the contrary. Similarly to those by the wayside, the serpent still tries to take away the word of God out of your heart. However, unlike those who are by the wayside, the serpent does not succeed in taking the word of God out of your heart; instead, you hold on to it. And similarly to those who are on the rock, you shall still experience challenging times. And the serpent shall still try to get you to lose faith in the Lord God, doubt the veracity of what He says to you, and fall away from Him. However, unlike those who are on the rock, you shall not let the challenging situations cause you to lose faith in the Lord God or doubt the veracity of word of God; instead, the relationship that you built with the Lord God shall not end but endure and strengthen as you experience those challenging situations. And like those among the thorns, the serpent shall still attempt to get you to pursue that which seems desirable and beneficial to you rather than pursuing the plans that the Lord God has for you so that you are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life. However, unlike those who are among the thorns, you shall not be fruitless because you stunted your growth and maturity by loving, desiring, and pursuing cares, riches, and pleasures of life rather than loving, desiring, and pursuing the Lord God; instead, you shall bear fruit because you chose to put the Lord God above all else. When you reach this stage in your walk of faith in the Lord God, you have shown yourself to have an honest and good heart. What this means is that you have shown to be faithful to the Lord God. And because you have shown yourself to be faithful to the Lord God, He may entrust you and give you more, including knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God. By the wayside. On the rock. Among the thorns. In good ground. Besides being an apt description of the stages that a person progresses through in their walk of faith in the Lord God, the parable of the sower also describes the Lord God’s unending love for you. And because of the Lord God’s unending love for you, He never leave you nor does He stop chasing after you irregardless of the choices that you make. For, if you are currently among the thorns and you decide to pursue the cares and riches and pleasures of life rather than the Lord God, resulting in you regressing to on the rocks, the Lord God does not stop pursuing you. He continues to speak to you and pursue you whilst you are on the rocks. Likewise, if your relationship with the Lord God is currently on the rock because of challenging situations that you experience and you decide to end your relationship with the Lord God, resulting in you regressing to by the wayside, the Lord God does not stop pursuing you. For, even though you are by the wayside, the Lord God continues to speak to you. In fact, the Lord God speaks to you and pursues you no matter what stage you are in. That is why you hear the word of God at each stage. At no stage in your walk of faith does the Lord God choose not to speak to you or pursue you. That is a testament of the Lord God’s unending love for you. And that is also a testament of His faithfulness to you. It is also a testament of His desire to begin and cultivate a relationship with you. Will you accept His invitation? It is a personal decision that you shall have to make but I hope that you do accept His invitation, for I believe that it is the bestest choice that you may make. God bless.","summary":"Parables are like encrypted messages. Only those with the decryption key may understand the message.

        "title":"Did God Really Say",
        "content_text":"Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’” “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” Genesis 3:1–5 NIV As it was mentioned in the previous story, Jesus cultivated a relationship with His Father in Heaven by regularly praying to and communing with His Father in Heaven. And through this relationship that He cultivated with His Father in Heaven, Jesus was able to gain some foresight into what was and is to come in His life. Similarly to Jesus, Adam and Eve also cultivated a relationship with the Lord God by regularly communing with Him. From this relationship that they cultivated with the Lord God, they were able to gain some foresight when the Lord God let them know in advance: “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” This is something that is good to know in advance, especially if you are not too keen on death. And for those who are not too keen on death, it is good to know if doing something shall certainly result in death, so that one may avoid doing the thing that shall certainly result in death. Now, the death that is mentioned here is not limited to the literal end of one’s life, for one’s life is not the only thing that may be considered dead. Anything that does not exist may be considered dead. And anything that is lacking may be considered dead. Anything that is lost may be considered dead. And anything that ceases to be may be considered dead. For example, your health may be considered dead if you cease to be healthy and become sick. Your career may be considered dead if you are unemployed or you are stuck in a dead end job that lacks fulfillment. And your finances may be considered dead if you lack enough money or lost all your money. Your house situation could be considered dead if you cease to own your home (maybe due to a dead financial situation) or lack a home big enough for your family. Your social situation could be considered dead if you lack or lost friends. And your family could be considered dead if you lost your significant other or you cease to be close with your relatives for whatever reason. And so forth. Now, similarly to Jesus and Adam and Eve, you too may cultivate a relationship with the Lord God by regularly communing with and praying to Him. From this relationship that you cultivate with the Lord God, you may gain foresight into what is to come in your life. Moreover, you may gain foresight into the things and the actions that will surely result in death. For example, the Lord God may tell you in advance that doing something shall certainly result in the death of your health. This is something that is good to know in advance, especially if you are not too keen on the death of your health, so that you may avoid doing the thing that shall certainly result in the death of your health. Also, the Lord God can let you know in advance when doing something will certainly result in the death of your career, business, financial, or housing situation. This is good to know in advance, so that you may avoid doing those things that will result in the death of those aspects of your life. Indeed, with a relationship that you cultivate with the Lord God, He may forewarn you when doing something shall certainly result in the death of any aspect of your life. Of course, as a person with free will and the freedom to make your own decisions, you may decide to listen and follow the advice that the Lord God has for you, or to not listen and follow the advice that the Lord God has for you. Adam and Eve also had the freedom to make the choice on whether or not they would listen to and follow the advice that the Lord God gave to them. Those two chose not to. Instead, the woman decided to listen to what the serpent said to her. The serpent said to the woman, “You will not certainly die,” if you eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil whilst the Lord God said the opposite to her. Now, she has a choice to make: to believe in what the Lord God said to her or to believe in what others (in this case, the serpent) said to her. That is a choice that she can make. She chose to believe what the serpent said to her over what the Lord God said to her. And because of this lack of belief in what the Lord God said to her, she ended up doing what the Lord God told her not to do. (Also, the man chose to heed the voice of the woman instead of the voice of the Lord God when she gave of the fruit of the tree to the man and he ate it.) Similarly to Adam and Eve, you may decide whether or not to believe in what the Lord God says to you. That is a choice that you may make. Now, other people (such as your friends and family) may also tell you things or give you advice on what to do. And that advice may be contrary to the advice that the Lord God gives you in a similar manner to how what the serpent said to the woman was contrary to what the Lord God told her. And when such a scenario happens, you have a choice to make: to follow the advice that the Lord God gives you, or to follow the advice that others give you. I suggest for you to always believe and follow the advice that the Lord God gives you rather than believing and following the advice that others give to you. Otherwise, you may be like the woman and the man and end up doing something that shall result in the death of you or some area of your life. For, in essence, a lack of belief in what the Lord God says leads to disobedience (not following what the Lord God told you to do or not to do) which ultimately leads to death (not necessarily of your life but some area of your life or some opportunity that the Lord God opened up for you). Now, there may be many reasons why the woman decided to do what the Lord God told her not to do. For one, it may be because she fell for one of the tactics that the serpent likes to employ. One of the tactics that the serpent employs so that you do not follow what the Lord God says is by getting you to question in your heart whether or not the Lord God really said what you think He said to you. The serpent used this trick on the woman by asking her, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” The serpent asked the woman that question in order to get her to doubt in her heart whether or not the Lord God actually said what she thinks He said to her be getting her to think that she is mistaken to think that the Lord God really said that to her. This trick that the serpent used against the woman is also employed against us in this day and age. When we spend some time to pray and commune with the Lord God, He shall respond to our prayers and communications with Him (because communication and relationships are a two way street). Sometimes, after the Lord God responds to our prayers and communications with Him, we doubt in our heart whether or not what the Lord God said to us is really what He said to us. Also, we sometimes wonder whether it was the Lord God’s voice that we heard speaking to us or if it was just our inner voice and imaginations. This doubting in our heart and wondering in our mind that we do is the work of the serpent. The serpent is attempting to employ against us the tactic that he employed on the woman. The serpent is trying to get us to doubt in our hearts whether or not what the Lord God said to us is really what He said by getting us to think that we are mistaken to think that He really said that to us. Now, the serpent does this because he does not want us thinking that we heard the Lord God lest we believe in Him. That is what the serpent fears. Therefore, we must understand this tactic of the serpent and realize when the serpent is trying to use this tactic against us so that we may guard against falling for this tactic of his. [Aside: As mentioned above, you may wonder how to know if what you think is the Lord God’s voice actually is His voice that is speaking to you. Well, when you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God by praying to and communing with Him (as well as reading the Scriptures), you shall become familiar with the Lord God’s voice. For example, let’s say you are in a room with a multitude of people. And in this room there is someone whom you are familiar with (and they with you) because you have built a relationship with them. Now, this person may be a family member or close friend or significant other. Now let’s say that this person calls out to you from somewhere behind you. Without turning around to see who it is, you may recognize who is calling out to you because you have become familiar with their voice in the process of time as you cultivated a relationship with them. It is similar with the Lord God. As you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God and get to know Him over time, you shall start to recognize His voice and become familiar with His voice. And when that happens, even though you do not see Him, you shall know that it is Him that is speaking to you.] Now, the above is not the only tactic in the serpent’s toolbox. If the serpent is not successful in using the above tactic against us, the serpent may try to downplay or get us to doubt the consequence of doing what the Lord God told us not to do (and vice versa). As mentioned above, the Lord God may let us know in advance when doing something shall certainly result in death. For example, the Lord God may warn us when doing something shall certainly result in the death of our finances. And when that happens, the serpent shall attempt to get us to doubt the veracity of what the Lord God told us. The serpent shall attempt to get us to not believe that certain aspects of our life shall certainly result in death if we do what the Lord God said not to. This is what the serpent did to the woman when he said, “You will not certainly die,” if you eat of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The serpent is trying to get her to doubt that she shall die when eating from that tree. And the serpent is also attempting to downplay and get her to doubt the consequences of doing what the Lord God said not to do. The serpent is trying to get her to doubt the veracity of what the Lord God said to her. This tactic of the serpent, when employed successfully, result in the death of our belief in the Lord God as well as what He says to us. That is the goal of the serpent: to get us to lose faith in the Lord God and what He says to us. The serpent does not want us to keep believing in the Lord God as well as what He says to us because he fears the outcome: us, alive in the Lord God. And so, we must be vigilant in understanding the tactics of the serpent as well as when he tries to use them against us so that we may guard against falling for his tactics. Now, besides downplaying the consequences of doing what the Lord God said not to, the serpent may also try to get the woman to believe it is more fruitful or beneficial to do what He said not to by playing up the benefits. The serpent attempted to convince the woman of that by saying, “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil,” to her. The serpent is trying to convince the woman that it would be better to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because her eyes will be opened and she will be like God, knowing good and evil. The serpent is trying to get the woman to pursue after what seems desirable (from her standpoint) instead of following what the Lord God told her to do. Likewise, the serpent is trying to get her to doubt that the Lord God knows what is best for her. This tactic that the serpent employed against the woman is the same tactic that he employs against us in this day and age. For example, the Lord God may tell us not to take the new job that requires relocation to a new city and country. And when the Lord God tells us not to do that thing, the serpent may spring into action and attempt to convince us that it will be better to do what the Lord God told us not to do. The serpent may try to convince us by outlining the perceived benefits of doing what the Lord God told us not to, such as, perhaps, an increase in compensation or other perks when compared to our current job and city/country of residence. By doing this, the serpent is attempting to get us to pursue that which seems desirable (from our standpoint) instead of following what the Lord God says. And the serpent is also trying to get us to doubt that the Lord God knows best. Although we may be convinced that it is better to do that which the Lord God told us not to, it is not; instead, it may be like a trojan horse—something that looks good and harmless but in reality leads to undesirable consequence. And so, when the Lord God suggests that we do or not do something, may I recommend that we trust in the Lord God and trust that He knows what is best for us. This is because what we are able to see of the trojan horse—the outside—may look good and harmless to us, however what we cannot see of the trojan horse—the inside—certainly leads to undesirable consequences. We can only see the outside of the trojan horse. The Lord God can see both the outside and inside. Thus, although it may seem more fruitful or beneficial to do what the Lord God told us not to do, may I suggest that we refrain from doing that which the Lord God told us not to do. For, while we may not understand why the Lord God told us not to do something that seems beneficial for us, just trust in Him; the Lord God has our best interest at heart. This tactic of the serpent, when successfully used against us, results in us pursuing after our own plans and desires for our life rather than following and fulfilling the plans the Lord God has for our life, for the serpent does not want us to follow and fulfill the plans that the Lord God has for our life because he fears the outcome: us growing and maturing in the Lord God and bearing fruit that will nourish (bless) others. When I say that the fruit that we bear will provide nourishment (blessing) to others, I mean that the fruit that we bear shall build up, strengthen, edify, encourage, and help others to grow and flourish as well as become more fruitful. However, this is not what the serpent wants; instead, he wants to destroy us by getting us to follow plans that seem to be desirable (from our standpoint) but leads to death (in our growth and fruitfulness). Thus, we must be vigilant in understanding the tactics of the serpent as well as when he tries to use them against us so that we may guard against falling for his tactics. [Aside: One may wonder why they should put their trust in the Lord God. As it was mentioned in the previous aside above, as you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God, you may learn to recognize and become familiar with His voice. That is not the only thing that you shall start to become familiar with. You shall also become familiar with the Lord God’s character as you cultivate a relationship with Him. Now, this is not too different from when you cultivate a relationship with someone else, such as a relative or significant other or friend. In the process of time, as you get to know them and become familiar with their voice, you shall also get to know their character. When you get to know the Lord God’s character, you shall find that He is trustworthy (amongst other characteristics).] The woman in the story decided not to trust in the Lord God. Now, there may be many reasons why a person decides not to trust in the Lord God. Besides thinking that you know what is best for your life whilst the Lord God does not, you may decide not to trust in the Lord God because you are not satisfied with your life and not satisfied with what the Lord God has given you. Instead, you desire more. You desire what the Lord God has not given you. This is basically what happened with the man and the woman. They were unsatisfied with what the Lord God had already given them. They desired more. In addition to what the Lord God had already given them, they also desired what the Lord God had not given them. As was mentioned earlier in the story, the Lord God said to them, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” The Lord God had given them every tree in the garden to eat from. Now, this presumably includes the tree of life that was also in the middle of the garden. The one and only tree they were not given to eat from was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Every other tree in the garden they could eat from. Yet, they were not satisfied with what they had already been given. They wanted more. In addition to being able to eat from all the other trees in the garden, they also wanted to eat the fruit from the one tree that was not given to them. So that is what they did. They chose to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which resulted in death, rather than eat from the tree of life that was also in the middle of the garden. They chose eating from that which results in death instead of eating from that which results in life! (Now, you may wonder why they never ate from the tree of life. Presumably they never ate from the tree of life because death was not a concern for them until they chose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus they never had a reason to eat from the tree of life before then.) Now, like the man and the woman, you too have a choice to make: to be satisfied with your life and what you have been given, or to be unsatisfied with your life and desire the things that the Lord God has not given to you. I suggest you choose the former. Moreover, like the man and the woman, you can choose that which leads to life or that which leads to death. I suggest you choose life. God bless.","summary":"When you cultivate a relationship with the Lord God, He may forewarn you when something will result in the death of any aspect of your life.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/51361957-b75da280-1a9f-11e9-8bde-704a26cc0d29.jpg","date_published": "2018-12-05T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death. They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later on two came forward, and said, “This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’” Matthew 26:59–61 NASB As mentioned in previous stories, anyone may accuse a person of certain things on the public forum of their choice. And sometimes the allegations that someone makes against a person are false. And yet, sometimes the people who hear those false allegations believe them to be true. And, since those who hear those false allegations believe them to be true, without fair trial or due process, those who hear those false allegations judge the accused as guilty as well as mete out the punishment that they have sentenced the accused to. And as mentioned in previous stories, those who believe those false allegations to be true may sentence you to a verbal stoning. You can also be imprisoned by the false allegation and be put into solitary confinement, never to be released, by those who believe the false allegations to be true, as they deem you to be a scourge on society to be locked up and avoided at all costs. However, as was mentioned in the previous stories, although you can find yourself isolated and abandoned by the people of this world because of the public response to those false allegations made against you, you are not alone. The Lord is always with you and the Lord shall never abandon you. Also, the Lord knows what you are going through because He Himself has experienced likewise. The chief priests and the whole council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus, so that they might sentence Him to death. Many false witnesses stepped forward and made false allegations against Him, including two who came and said, “This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’” When those two stepped forward and claimed that Jesus said a certain thing, those two were misrepresenting what Jesus actually said. What Jesus had actually said was, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Besides purposefully misconstruing His words so that the chief priests and whole council may have reason to sentence Him to death, those two may have misconstrued His words due to an unintentional misunderstanding of what He meant when He said those words. Whilst those two people who claimed that Jesus said a certain thing may have thought He was referring to a temple that took forty-six years to build when He said the words, “Destroy this temple…”, in fact, the temple that He was referring to was His body. This purposeful or unintentional distortion of the words that a person says happens in this day and age as well. In this day and age, this may be referred to as fake news. And so, if you hear about the words that someone allegedly said, may I suggest that you refrain from condemning that someone since the person who made known and attributed those words to that someone may have purposefully or unintentionally misconstrued that someone’s words. As well, by refraining from condemning someone for the words attributed to them by a person who brought to light and attributed the words to that someone, you can avoid wrongfully convicting someone for saying something that they did not really say. Instead, as mentioned in previous stories, might I suggest you direct your gaze inwards to evaluate yourself to see if you are with or without sin. And if you take the time to do that, then I reckon that you shall be convicted by your conscience as it brings to light the sins that you are with. By the same token, if you are an avid user of social media platforms—such as Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram—then just realize that what happened to Jesus may happen to you. One day you may find yourself being condemned by a multitude of people after someone decides to accuse you of saying a certain thing. And similar to how those two people misconstrued the words that they claimed Jesus said, the someone who chose to accuse you of saying a certain thing may also purposefully or unintentionally misrepresent the words that they are attributing to you. And with the advent and proliferation of the Internet and social media platforms able to keep a history of all the words that you have shared with the world, it has become really easy for a person to find and distort the words that you have shared over the years. In Jesus’ time, the chief priests and the whole council had to find someone willing to remember, share, and misconstrue the words that He said. Now, a person just has to utilise a social media platform’s search feature to find and misconstrue the words that a person has said over time. And this person may choose to do such a thing to someone in order to imprison that someone and destroy that someone’s life and future. Now, this is not too different from what the chief priests and the whole council decided to do to Jesus. They actively sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they may have reason to sentence Him to death. And in addition to being sentenced to death, Jesus also experienced beatings, mockings, having verbal stones being thrown at Him, abandonment by the people of the world, as well as imprisonment. And so, Jesus certainly knows what you are going through if you happen to find yourself being condemned by a multitude of people of this world for the words that someone has decided to bring to light and attribute to you. Now, take heart! The condemnation and imprisonment Jesus experienced did not last forever; it was only temporary. People of this world tried to keep Him in the box (the tomb) that they placed Him inside and tried to keep Him from escaping from the situation that they boxed Him into (by sealing the tomb and placing a guard in front of the sealed tomb). The people of this world planned to box Him into the situation that they placed Him in. While the people of this world planned to keep Jesus imprisoned (in the tomb that they put Him inside and sealed), never to be released, the Lord made a way to free Jesus from the imprisonment that He was in. And after some time, the condemnation He experienced at the hands of the people of this world ceased, the Lord made a way to free Jesus from the imprisonment that He was in, He was raised up by the Lord to sit at the right hand of the Power of God, and He was given all authority in heaven and on earth. Like Jesus above, the imprisonment Joseph experienced because of the false allegations that were made against him, as is mentioned in the last story, did not last forever; it was only temporary. After a little while, the Lord made a way for him to be freed from the imprisonment he was in. And like Jesus above, Joseph was lifted him up by the Lord. Joseph was made a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Therefore, if you find yourself, like Jesus and Joseph, being imprisoned by purposefully or unintentionally misconstrued allegations that someone decided to make against you, just believe and know with certainty in your heart that what you are experiencing shall not last forever; it is only temporary. And similar to Jesus, the people of this world may try to keep you in the prison that they put you in. The people of this world may try and keep you from escaping from the situation that they boxed you into. And the people of this world may have plans to box you into the situation that they placed you in. While the people of this world planned to keep you imprisoned, like Jesus and Joseph, the condemnation that you experience at the hands of the people of the world shall cease, the Lord shall make a way to free you from the imprisonment that you are in, and the Lord will lift you up to a wonderful future. Just believe, for the plans that the Lord has for your life are greater than the plans that people of this world has for your life. And His plans for your life shall prevail over the people of this world’s plans for your life similarly to how the Lord’s plans for Jesus’ and Joseph’s lives prevailed over the people of this world’s plans for their lives. Now, you may wonder why the Lord allowed you to experience such a thing in the first place. As it is mentioned in the previous story, Joseph might have wondered the same thing whilst in the midst of the turmoil that he was experiencing as it might not have been readily apparent at the time. But, in the process of time, Joseph eventually realized in hindsight: “God sent me ahead of you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a great deliverance. Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 45:7–8 HCSB). Joseph also realized that: “You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people” (Genesis 50:20 NLT). With some foresight, Jesus ascertained that: “But all this has taken place so that the Scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled” (Matthew 26:56 AMP). Now, God the Father in Heaven assuredly could have intervened and prevented the things that happened to Jesus. Jesus Himself was sure of this, as He says: “Do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will immediately provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matthew 26:53 AMP) However, if such an appeal were granted, then the plans that God the Father in Heaven had for Jesus would not have been fulfilled. For, as Jesus also says, “How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?” (Genesis 26:54 AMP) Things had to happen in a certain way so that the plans that God the Father in Heaven had for Jesus would be fulfilled. In essence, Jesus understood that the accusations of Him leading an insurrection resulted in His persecution as well as His crucifixion and ultimately His resurrection. Therefore, if God the Father in Heaven intervened and prevented certain things from happening in Jesus’ life, then God the Father in Heaven would also be intervening and preventing His plans for Jesus from being fulfilled. Jesus understood these things with foresight as opposed to knowing these things in hindsight like Joseph because He cultivated a relationship with God the Father in Heaven. And through time spent praying and communing with God the Father in Heaven, Jesus was able to gain foresight into what is to come. Similarly to Jesus, you may cultivate a relationship with God the Father in Heaven. And through communing as well as praying to God the Father in Heaven, you may gain foresight into what is to come in your life. With this foresight, you too may realize that God the Father in Heaven could intervene and prevent others from condemning and imprisoning you due to the misconstrued words that others attributed to you. However, if God the Father in Heaven did that, He would be intervening and preventing His plans for your life from being fulfilled. So, while it may not be pleasant to experience being condemned and imprisoned by the people of this world because of the misconstrued words that others attribute to you, just believe and know with certainty in your heart that this has taken place so that the plans that God the Father in Heaven has for you shall be fulfilled. God bless.","summary":"Although you may be imprisoned by the people of this world because of the false allegations made against you, the Lord shall set you free.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/51361906-88473100-1a9f-11e9-9cde-c1dc80544c5d.jpg","date_published": "2018-11-28T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt. An Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there. Genesis 39:1 HCSB Joseph was purchased by Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard. And he became a servant in Potiphar’s household. In other words, Joseph became an au pair. Eventually, he was promoted by Potiphar and became his personal assistant as well as the overseer of his house. Now, Potiphar had a wife. His wife was attracted to Joseph. Every day, she tried to seduce him. Every day, he declined her advances. One day, when she found him alone in the house, she grabbed ahold of his garment and again tried to seduce him. Nevertheless, he escaped her grasp and fled outside, leaving behind his garment. Now, with his garment in her hand as evidence, she gathered the other servants of the house and falsely accused Joseph of trying to rape her. When Potiphar, her husband, came home, she repeated her false allegations to him. What she did to Joseph is not too different from what the scribes and Pharisees from the last story did to the woman caught in the very act of adultery. Like the scribes and Pharisees from the previous story, Potiphar’s wife decided to publicly accuse a person of certain actions. So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, “Your servant did to me after this manner,” that his anger was aroused. Then Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison. Genesis 39:19–20 NKJV As mentioned in the previous story, when you hear about the actions of a person from someone who chose to bring to light those actions of that person, you have a choice on how to respond. You may respond in a similar manner to those who heard the accusations that the scribes and Pharisees made against that woman caught in the act of adultery—by judging the accused of being guilty and meting out the punishment that you have sentenced them to, all without fair trial or due process. Or you may respond in a similar manner to Jesus when he heard the scribes’ and Pharisees’ accusations against the woman caught in the very act of adultery—not by condemning them but by standing up for them and standing by their side. The wife’s husband and Joseph’s master, Potiphar, decided upon the first option. (Now, this is not to imply that Potiphar took the time to deliberate before choosing a course of action. For all intents and purposes, I reckon, Potiphar #BelievedHer.) So, without a fair trial or due process, Potiphar judged Joseph guilty of raping his wife and meted out the punishment that he sentenced him to by taking and putting him into prison. But that ought not to be! Just because a person chose to publicly accuse someone of certain actions, it does not mean that those allegations are true. Potiphar’s wife made the choice to accuse Joseph of raping her. But as we can see from this story, those allegations of hers were false. However, those who heard her allegations against Joseph believed them to be true. And because they believed those allegations to be true, without a trial or due process, those who heard the allegations judged Joseph guilty and meted out the punishment that they sentenced him to by taking and putting him into prison. In other words, he was wrongfully convicted and punished for actions that he did not do. Not only was he thrown into prison, he also lost his job, his dignity, and his future. Joseph started off as an au pair and then worked his way up to overseer over Potiphar’s house. If not for the false allegation that were made against him, Joseph may have continued his upward trajectory. Instead, he was taken down to prison. What happened to Joseph is not too different from what happens to people in this day and age. As mentioned in the previous story, anyone may accuse a person of certain actions through the public forum of their choosing. Sometimes, the allegations that somebody makes public against a person are false. Although the allegations are false, the public who hears the allegation believe them to be true. And because they believe those allegations to be true, without fair trial or due process, those who hear the allegations judge the accused as guilty and mete out the punishment that they have sentenced the accused to. As mentioned in the previous story, these include throwing verbal stones—such as shaming, insults, vitriol, harassments, death threats, calls for them to resign or be fired—at the accused. Like Joseph, the accused may also be imprisoned. While Joseph was taken and put into a physical prison, in this day and age, the accused are imprisoned by the false allegations that are made against them. Like a ball and chain shackled to the accused, the false allegations may always be attached to them. It may follow them everywhere they go, forever handcuffing them and making it difficult for them to move forward with their lives. Likewise, those who are accused may become isolated from society as they are deemed to be a scourge on society because of the false allegations made against them. It is as if the accused has an incurable infectious disease that requires them to be isolated and quarantined so that it does not spread to others. And it is as if the accused are put into solitary confinement by society, never to be released again, so that they may not harm others in society. But that ought not to be! Just because a person decides to publicly accuse someone of some actions, it does not mean that those allegations are true. Therefore, might I suggest that you refrain from condemning people who have been publicly accused of certain actions by others since those allegations may be false. Instead, might I suggest that you follow the example that Jesus sets. Being falsely accused may also happen to you. And, I reckon that you would prefer not to be condemned because of the false allegations that someone made against you, nor would you prefer to have your life and future derailed because of the false allegations that someone made against you. But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. Genesis 39:21 NKJV Now, although Joseph found himself isolated from society because of the false allegations that were made against him, he was not alone. The Lord was with him. And, even though Joseph found himself abandoned by the rest of society, the Lord did not abandon him. The Lord was with him. Although Joseph found himself in prison because of the false allegations that were made against him, the Lord made a way for him to be freed from the prison that he found himself in. Like Joseph, if you happen to find yourself isolated from society by the people of this world because they decided to believe the false allegations that someone made against you, just believe and know with certainty in your heart that the Lord is always with you. Furthermore, like Joseph, if you happen to find yourself abandoned by the people of this world, just believe and know assuredly that the Lord shall never abandon you. And, like Joseph, if you happen to find yourself imprisoned by the false allegations that were made against you, then just believe and know with certainty in your heart that the Lord shall make a way to free you from the imprisonment that you are in. Now, you may wonder why the Lord allowed such a thing to happen to you in the first place. Joseph may have wondered the same thing whilst in prison. Whilst imprisoned and amidst the turmoil that he was experiencing, the reason why the Lord allowed such a thing to happen to him may have stayed hidden instead of being readily apparent. Eventually, Joseph discovered why the Lord allowed this thing to happen to him as it became apparent to him in the process of time. In the process of time, Joseph realized: “God sent me ahead of you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a great deliverance. Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 45:7–8 HCSB). Joseph also realized: “You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people” (Genesis 50:20 NLT). The many lives who were saved included his brothers, who hated on him and thought about killing him, and, presumably, Potiphar and his wife—the former being the one who imprisoned Joseph because of the false allegations that the latter made against him. Like Joseph, the reasons why the Lord allowed such a thing to happen to you may stay hidden instead of being readily apparent to you whilst you are imprisoned and in the midst of the turmoil that you are experiencing. And similarly to Joseph, you may eventually discover why the Lord allowed this thing to happen to you as it becomes apparent to you in the process of time. With some hindsight, you may realize what Joseph realized: while those who spread false allegations against you and those who judge you and condemn you because of those false allegations against you intended to harm you, God intends this for good. And you may realize that God brought you to this position that you are in so that you may save a multitude of people, including: people who despise you, people who made allegations against you, and people who believed those allegations and judged you as guilty and meted out the punishment that they have sentenced you to. Joseph was brought to Egypt by a caravan of Ishmaelite traders. That caravan of Ishmaelite traders were in possession of him since one of Joseph’s brothers, Judah, had an epiphany: instead of killing him, let’s sell him to this caravan of Ishmaelite traders who happen to be passing through and going to Egypt. The brothers who heard his idea agreed. So that is what they did. Judah and his brothers sold their other brother, Joseph, to those Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. (Now, some may have heard that there is a caravan of people travelling from one place to another place. The caravan contains people who are coming from a place where they are hated, persecuted, and in danger and going to a place where they hope to start anew. This is not too different from Joseph who was hated by his brothers and in danger of being killed by them. And similarly to Joseph, those in this caravan who reach their new country of residence may find themselves employed as au pairs. The Lord may also have a purpose for those who are in this caravan, though, like Joseph, those in the caravan may not realize it at the moment. The Lord’s purpose for the people in this caravan may be to establish them within the land that they are travelling to and saving a multitude of people. Like Joseph, the people that they save may include the citizens of the land that they are travelling to as well as the family that the people in this caravan had to leave behind in their original country of residence. For, after Joseph became established within Egypt, the rest of his family was able to migrate from their country of origin to be with Joseph in Egypt. In this day and age, this might now be referred to as family reunification or chain migration. Thus, although the people of this caravan may experience challenges as they try to start their lives anew in their new country of residence, the Lord certainly has a reason, a purpose for those in the caravan. Just believe.) At some point in time, Judah left his brothers to visit a friend. Whilst there, Judah met and married a woman. They had three sons together: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah found a woman named Tamar for his eldest son, Er, to marry. Some time after Er married Tamar, he died. And then Onan died. Judah’s wife eventually died as well. One day, he chose to go some place with a friend. Upon hearing about his plans, Tamar decided to cover herself with a veil and wrap herself in order to disguise herself, and sit in an open place that was on the way to the place that Judah was going. Upon seeing her, Judah propositioned her because he thought that she was a harlot. After they negotiated and agreed upon the terms and cost of their arrangement, he went into her. About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!” Genesis 38:24 NIV When Tamar was found to be with child, she was accused of prostitution. Her father-in-law, Judah, heard the accusations that were made against her. Now, as mentioned in the previous story, when you hear about the actions of a person from someone who chose to bring to light the actions of that person, you have a choice on how to respond. You may respond in a like manner to those who heard the allegations that the scribes and Pharisees made against that woman caught in the act of adultery—by judging the accused of being guilty and meting out the punishment that you have sentenced them to, all without a fair trial or due process. Or you may respond in a like manner to Jesus when he heard the scribes’ and Pharisees’ accusations against the woman caught in the very act of adultery—not by condemning them but by standing up for them and standing by their side. Judah chose the former. Judah said, “Bring her out and have her burned to death!” Without a fair trial or due process, Judah chose to judge her as guilty and sentence her to be burned to death. However, as mentioned in the previous story, rather than responding in that manner, Jesus recommends that you direct your gaze inwards to evaluate yourself to see if you are with or without sin. And if you take the time to do that, you shall be convicted by your conscience as it brings to light your sins in a similar manner to how the people who heard the accusations that the scribes and Pharisees made against the woman caught in adultery were convicted by their conscience. And as mentioned in the previous story, it is possible that one day someone can decide to bring to light those sins of yours on the public forum of their choice. And if that happens, I reckon that you would prefer mercy rather than condemnation from those who heard the accusations made against you. Judah found himself in such a situation. When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these belong, I am with child.” And she said, “Please determine whose these are—the signet and cord, and staff.” So Judah acknowledged them and said, “She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son.” And he never knew her again. Genesis 38:25–26 NKJV The signet and cord, and staff belongs to her father-in-law. Thus, Judah is the father of the child that Tamar is with. Upon seeing his signet and cord, and staff, Judah was convicted by his conscience as it brought to light the sins that he is with. Upon seeing his signet and cord, and staff, Judah realized he is with sin. Likewise, I reckon that he realized that Tamar could have brought to light those sins of his by making them known to others, in a similar manner to how her actions were made known to Judah by others. And if that were to happen to him, I reckon that Judah realized that the people who hear about those actions of his may judge him as guilty and mete out the punishment that they sentence him to in a similar fashion to how he judged her as guilty and sentenced her to be burned to death. And I reckon that he realized that he would prefer that he be shown mercy by those who hear about those actions of his rather than be condemned by them. I reckon that Judah also ascertained that he is not more righteous than Tamar, for he said, “She has been more righteous than I…”, thus he does not have the moral authority to condemn her. Likewise, I reckon that, since we are all with sin, we are no more righteous than others. Therefore, we ought not to condemn others, for we are not morally superior to others. What we are is a people who are with sin. And yet, even though we are with sin, we are loved. Loved by the Lord. Loved by Jesus. We are never condemned by Him; rather, we are all beloved by Him. Therefore, might I suggest that you do likewise—that you refrain from condemning others irregardless of the sins that they are allegedly with. Instead, might I recommend that you love everyone irregardless of their alleged sins in a similar manner to how Jesus loves you irregardless of your sins. Joseph and Judah. Two brothers. One was despised by the other. One of them was a lowly slave who was falsely accused and condemned for certain actions; meanwhile, the other one acquitted himself as someone who has the moral authority to condemn someone of being a harlot, a person who is despised by others. And yet, the Lord used Joseph, the lowly slave falsely accused and condemned for certain actions, to become established in the land of Egypt and save a multitude of people, while Judah, who acquitted himself as somebody with the moral authority to judge and condemn others, was brought to nothing by people who are lowly and despised, first by someone who was despised for harlotry, and later by Joseph who was despised by his brothers. Thus, the Lord lifts up the lowly and despised who are brought down by people who condemn them for certain actions that others accuse them of. Conversely, the Lord brings down (humbles) those who self-righteously condemn people who are lowly and despised for the actions that others accuse them of. And as we can see from the tales of these two brothers, the Lord may bring down those who self-righteously condemn people by using the very same people that they condemned to bring them down. So, although you may be lowly and despised according to the eyes of the world, you are not lowly and despised in the eyes of the Lord. Likewise, although you may think yourself as morally superior to others, the Lord may not have the same view of you. Therefore, humble yourselves lest the Lord humble you for you. God bless.","summary":"In this day and age, those who are publicly accused on a social media platform are imprisoned by the false allegations made against them.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/51095356-34c4a280-1782-11e9-96d6-affcacc2dbf3.png","date_published": "2018-11-21T00:00:00+00:00",

        "content_text":"Now early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them. Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” John 8:2–5 NKJV Early in the morning Jesus came again into the temple. Whilst there, Jesus sat down and taught all the people who came to Him. Whilst teaching, the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman who was caught in adultery and then set her in the midst of all the people who were there. I reckon that most, if not all, of the people who were there did not know her. And to all the people who were there and did not know her, the scribes and Pharisees brought to light certain actions of this woman. In the presence of all who were there, they said to Jesus, “This woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.” In essence, these scribes and Pharisees decided to bring to light who this woman was and certain actions of hers by accusing this woman in a public forum that is frequented by a multitudes of people who do not know her. Sound familiar? What happened to this woman happens to people in this day and age as well. The main difference between then and now is the forum. Now, with the advent and growth of the Internet and social media platforms—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter—anyone can bring to light the actions of someone to a multitude of people who previously did not know this someone. And what a person brings to light through their preferred social media platform may, with the press of a button, quickly spread like wildfire as other people share this revelation to their social network friends and followers. What happens whenceforth is similar to what happened to the woman who was caught in the act of adultery. Without a trial or due process, the woman was judged guilty and sentenced to be stoned to death. Like that woman, a person may, without trial or due process, be judged guilty and sentenced to be stoned to death when somebody decides to bring to light the actions of a person by publicly accusing that person on a public forum that is frequented by a multitude of people who do not know that person. In the story of that woman, that woman was sentenced to be stoned to death by actual stones. Now, people are sentenced to verbal stones— harassment, shaming, insults, vitriol, death threats, calls for them to resign or be fired, and the like—being thrown toward them by a multitude of people who do not know them, yet banded together to mete out the punishment that they have sentenced the accused to. Like swarms of locusts that band together and devour crops in a field, leaving behind only death and destruction, so too do people in this day and age band together to swarm those whose actions have been brought to light. And when this swarm of people finish devouring said person, leaving behind only death and destruction, these people move on to the next person to swarm, devour, and destroy. But that ought not to be! That woman was sentenced to death via stoning because that was the de jure law of the land in those days. Now, judging and sentencing and meting out punishment without a fair trial or due process has become the de facto law of the land. However, rather than doing what has become the de facto law in this day and age, may I suggest that you ask Jesus the same question that the scribes and Pharisees asked Him: “What do You say [to do]?” And you may discover that His response to you is similar to His response to the scribes and Pharisees and all who were present in that place. So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.” And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. John 8:7–9 NKJV The people who were there asked Jesus a couple of times before He answered. (Sometimes, when seeking an answer from Him, you have to be persistent and ask Him multiple times before He gives you a reply to your question.) Eventually, Jesus replied. He said to those who were there: “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.” He suggested that they focus their gaze inwards and evaluate themselves and see if they are with or without sin. And then He stooped down to give them a chance to do as He suggested. After some time, all who were there left because all were with sin. Not one was without sin. I reckon that the people who were there realized that, since they too are with sin, it is surely possible that someone may some day bring to light that sin of theirs to a multitude of people who do not know them in a like manner to how the scribes and Pharisees brought to light the actions of the woman who was standing before them. And I reckon that those who were there realized that, if that sin of theirs were brought to light one day, then they might find themselves in the same position that the woman caught in the act of adultery found herself in: amid a multitude of people willing to judge and mete out the punishment that they have sentenced her to without a fair trial and due process. And I imagine that those people who were there realized that, if they ever found themselves in a similar situation as that woman, they would prefer mercy rather than a stoning by multitudes that do not know them, yet banded together to mete out the punishment that they have sentenced them to. And so, might I suggest that you do likewise? That you take a moment to focus your gaze inwards to evaluate yourself to see if you are with or without sin the next time you feel compelled to judge and mete out the punishment that you have sentenced those whose actions have been brought to light. Like the people who were surrounding the woman, I reckon that you too shall be convicted by your conscience since it shall bring to light the sins that are with you. And so, may I also suggest that you come to the same realizations that I reckon those people surrounding the woman came to: that it is surely possible to one day find yourself in a position wherein multitudes of people that do not know you band together to, without a trial or due process, judge you for actions that have been brought to light by some person, sentence you, as well as mete out the punishment that they have sentenced you to. Thus, the next time that you feel compelled to mete out punishment to those whose actions have been brought to light, might I also suggest that you respond with mercy rather than judgment. The people surrounding that woman left one by one after they were all convicted by their conscience until only Jesus was left with the woman. Jesus was the only one willing to stand up for her and stand by her side in the midst of the turmoil that she was experiencing. No one else was willing to stand up for her or stand by her side. Only Jesus. (I reckon He did not quickly answer the scribe and Pharisees’ question because Jesus wanted to give those who were there a chance to speak up and stand up for her.) Thus, if you ever find yourself witnessing someone being swarmed by multitudes who decided to condemn them without a trial or due process, may I recommend that you step in and stand up for them in the midst of the turmoil that they are experiencing? Likewise, if you find yourself in the midst of a swarm of people who are judging you and meting out the punishment that they have sentenced you to without a fair trial or due process, just believe and know with certainty in your heart that there is One who will always stand up for you and stand by your side: Jesus. Also, He shall never condemn you. Although you may find yourself in a situation where you are being condemned by a multitude of people who do not know you, Jesus shall not condemn you in a similar manner to how He did not condemn that woman caught in the act of adultery. Just believe. In short, this story mentioned three types of people: the scribes and Pharisees, who publicly accused a woman of certain actions; the people who heard those accusations against her and were willing to, without fair trial and due process, judge her as guilty and mete out the punishment that they have sentenced her to; and Jesus, who stood by her side and did not condemn her. You can decide whose example to follow. You can decide to follow the example set by the scribes and Pharisees. You can decide to follow the example set by the people that heard the accusation made against the woman. Or you can follow the example set by Jesus. I suggest you follow the example set by Jesus, but it is ultimately up to you. Choose wisely, my friends. God bless.","summary":"Like swarms of locusts that devour crops in a field, leaving behind only death and destruction, so too do people in this day and age swarm those whose action have been made public on social media.","image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45976390/72771830-23ea1080-3bd0-11ea-8eb0-4468eb3bdc8f.jpg","date_published": "2018-11-14T00:00:00+00:00",
