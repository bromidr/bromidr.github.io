# The Abraham Rule: The Bible may say "Person A knew Person B" to indicate, in a
# euphemistic manner, that "Person A had sex with Person B." If the person that
# they knew is not their spouse, then they shall be put in the "knows" category
# whilst any resulting children shall be placed in the "children" category along
# with any children that the person had with their spouse.
# See, for example: Lot; Nahor, Son Of Terah;
sibling: [Nahor Son Of Terah, Haran, Sarah]
spouse: [Sarah, Keturah]
knows: [Hagar]
children: [Ishmael, Isaac, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, Shuah]
